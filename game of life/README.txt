Hello, thank you for visiting my repo. Conway's Game of Life simulates reproduction, overpopulation and underpopulation. It is satisfying to see the various patterns
emerging through the several generations that come from a starting configuration.
This is reproduced using PyGame.

Button Functionalities:
Run: Runs the starting configuration
Pause: Pause to view the current generation
Reset: Reset back to a blank slate
Random: Randomly turns about 1/4 of the cells alive
Get Last: Get the last ran configuration
Infinite: Removes the grid borders. Cells that pass the right border end up back on the left border etc.
Save: Saves the current grid to "save.png", allows reproduction of current state from the png file
Load: Loads the current "save.png" representing the current state
