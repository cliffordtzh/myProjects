I visited on a Saturday afternoon with no booking, paid and went in for my massage. My therapist came in and I said hello as she didn't say anything then she replied with an unenthusiastic hello. No name given. Until she said to turn over, that was all she said until I was told the massage was over.

At times when I was face down, the massage went limp and repetitive and I wondered if she was on her phone. When I turned over, her phone was on the stool she got up from.

The massage was 3/10 in terms of quality. The oil had no aroma and it was a $75 aromatherapy massage I decided to have as a treat. It was no treat!

When I got dressed, I checked the time as it felt a short massage. It was 6:58 and my payment receipt showed 5:59, making a 60 min appointment impossible unless the till was wrong but from memory it seemed right. I mentioned it to the receptionist but she just shrugged it off. I didn't bother to show her the receipt and just left. The man inquiring about a massage also left!

Looking on this website now, it seems the aim of this spa is not for women to have a good massage. I couldn't recognise my therapist on the website. It was a shame my experience was so poor, as its close to where I live and the surroundings were nice and the music in the room was relaxing.

Maybe a man will get a better experience.

Was impressed by how the reception welcome me when I stepped in to this place. She patiently recommended me the packages they have. The whole session was relaxing,  clean room,  masseur's skill and the soft soothing music. Will definitely return n strongly recommended.

Just had my aching bones serviced here by Joey.
Tried their Lymphatic massage and Turkish bubble massage.
My back so much more relaxed and the Turkish bubble massage is such an relaxed experience. Right now, I felt so much recharged to get back to work!
For those not tried this treatment before, I highly recommend it!
And there's free parking here as well.
Best to call and make appointment before heading down to avoid wait and crowd.

Place is clean and hygienic with nice n cozy decoration. Bosses and staffs are friendly with good attitude. My favourite place to relax myself after a hard day work, parking space right in front of the shop is a bonus! Keep it up!!

Visited this spa along 531 Balestier Road  opposite Zhong Shan mall ,probably the best around this area. Young and cheerful genuine experienced masseuse leading you into clean and cosy rooms with soft music, all with attached bath. Appreciate their efforts to keep the place organized and well lit. Importantly the masseuse is never rushing for time, even with a bit of overrun.

The photos of the girls here are just models to attract guys, don't be fooled by it. In fact the photos of the girls working only initially when they open many years ago! Don't expect same if you think you want similar standards of girls serving you!
