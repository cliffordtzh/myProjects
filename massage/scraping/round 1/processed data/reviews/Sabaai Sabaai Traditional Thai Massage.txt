Chanced upon this place while looking for massages nearby and picked it solely based on the high Google review ratings. Best decision made! Tried the Thai Aroma massage which has four scents to choose from, and the masseuse really worked hard on those knots in my back  my whole body felt so relieved after 90 min! The staff were really friendly and the place was well decorated. Price is a bit higher than some other common massage parlours I think (?) but totally worth it. Already planning the next trip, and thinking of getting a package  looking forward to going back there soon!

Was trawling through reddit for some good places to get a massage and chanced upon this gem. It was defs worth the price and the good reviews! Went for the Thai Signature with my partner and we both loved it. He commented that he would 100% recommend it and he found the massage comprehensive with excellent back manipulation  Just as other commenters remarked, our masseuses managed to hit the right spots with just the right amount of pressure.

My masseuse (Sophia) was really strong and responsive to my verbal/non-verbal cues. We will definitely be back for more!

One of the best thai massage places you can find here in singapore.

Super clean place - nice robes for you to change into, toilet though a bit small was clean - had kirei kirei!

Though prices are a little premium as compared to overseas or in JB. You really get a quality full body thai traditional Thai massage that will leave you wanting more.

They have a chop system as well as you can collect and get discounts if you are a loyal returning customer...

Definitely book a slot and try it for yourself!

75 for an hour of Thai traditional massage!

Only bummer is that somehow their payment system doesn't accept contactless paywave options and you have to bring your physical credit card if you'll like to use your credit card to pay!

Highly recommended. The masseuse I had, Li Ping, was very skillful. She was very attentive and was able to find the accurate spots I was having problems with. I had 1hr Traditional Thai + 2hrs Aroma massage. Was a great combo to get rid of all body aches and stiffness. Will definitely return again.

First time doing Full body Thai massage, and Sabaai Sabaai Traditional Thai Massage provided an excellent experience.

The place is easy to miss, and you have to lookout for the sign. Overall a good experience!

I took 30 minutes/ foot massage. 

I'd like to make a reservation at 8 pm. But at 7:13 pm the massage club called me and said 8 pm is full booking, so I have to come by 7:30 pm.

I called on time without being late. I visited at the time they wanted, hoping for better service. (If they had at least the average massage level, I wouldn't have written this review.)

At The first time it wasn't bad. (Greeting service, beverage service etc..)
Desk staff were friendly and beverage service was good. And the tea was also good.

< Foot Massage started. >

* massage
The first pressure to me for left foot massage was weak and insincere.
I majored in art, knows a little bit of anatomy. Also Massage experience is a lot as well.

Unfortunately, the pressure is too weak to a viable level for baby. (This is not a massage, just touching.)

But I did not say any compliments at first.

Because I thought there will be the therapists intention or purpose of the first time introduction stage and still believe.....

15 minutes left. To be honest, At that time feel bad. (Theres no therapists intention or purpose. She just... It became apparent that the time was being spent by forcefully.)

But the therapist condition is good or thought there may be many other reasons.. So I told her
softly, just press more than the left foot.

The right foot was better than the left touch level. I'm not satisfied with my right side, but I'm just touching my left foot.

I thought I waste of money and time.

No difference whatsoever after the massage are tired of the foot and calf.

< 5 minutes left. >

I saw a new guest wash her by other therapist.

So I ask the my therapist.

Why I never wash my feet like her?
Then my therapist replied.
Because I am taking a half-hour massage. And
this massage is not included the washing feet service. So I took just wash your feet as a wet towel.
If you want to wash your feet service,
You have to pay an additional $ 10. Would you take a feet washing service?

The massage was only five minutes remaining in. (Also, If the foot service is not to be included in a 30-minute period, the massage club or therapist should have made the announcement beforehand.)

Wast time and money...

If I was satisfied with today, I would visit again tomorrow with my friend, but I never will. Never go.

Update on 6/3/18 : price has increased to $80 for Thai massage. Didnt inquire about massage. Still  reasonable pricing. Previous review: $68 for 60mins. Jasmine: recommend for females (medium strength) Great masseur, know what she's doing. Went for traditional Thai massage (no oil) and she helped relieved many knots which I didn't even know I had! Bought a package for $620 (10 times)

Great place for Traditional Thai Massage. Went on a Sunday evening. Very serene and comfortable. My masseuse was Zhang Qin. I walked in with back aches and walked out with none. They are good at identifying the pressure points to release the pains.
