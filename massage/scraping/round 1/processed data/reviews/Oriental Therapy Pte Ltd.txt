Had my chiropractic here, very experienced chiropractor, she knows where is my pain spot and how to relieve my pain. Cupping/guasha is complementary, too. Very worthy. The shop is nicely decorated, free bottled waters are provided, will definitely visit again.

I went for Tuina for the first time, upon following my husband. I was not really into massage and stuff, but after this session i can really feel my body was lighter, relaxed, and overall better. The therapist is friendly and helpful, so does the receptionist. She knows what she pressed, not just simply rub. Will come again for more session

Clean environment and polite staff who were not pushy. Tuina massage was good (painful but that is what tuina is). Will recommend Le Le and Rachel! Do call to book a slot before heading down. For those who are driving, you can park in the condominium's carpark.

It's not easy to find great foot reflexology that meets expectations but Oriental Therapy quite literally hits the spot! My masseuse Joyce was great - applying the right amount of pressure and ensuring I was comfortable throughout. Cozy interiors and warm, friendly staff. 10/10 will come back and am considering signing up for a package when I do.

I went for the first time after 2 friends both recommended Susan. I got preexisting condition n Susan take note about that seriously. She is able to identify what are my issues, and relieving them. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Will be back for more session.

My back pain had troubled me for a long long time. I have been searching for a good chiropractor but to avail. I found them and tried their service, it works perfectly for me. The pain is gone and I have adjusted my backbone and its better than before.

They have TCM treatment and massage too

Highly recommended to try out their treatments. It might cure your body ache and give you a healthy body too.

Came across Oriental Therapy while searching on Google for Tuina Massage located nearer to the west as I plan for treatment on weekdays after working hours to destress.

Reached out to them via WhatsApp message on last Monday afternoon, Amelia was very quick to respond. They have female masseuse which matches my own preference, Orthopedist too. She is very helpful in giving recommendations to what kind of treatment is suited for me and my partner. E.g. Mentioning that if having muscle pain or sore, she recommends normal Tuina, as for me I have a permanent swell hence she recommend orthopedist but only if I'm comfortable.

I made an appointment with her for the next day evening. Location-wise, it is easy to find - one of the shops located right along Alexis Condo (nearest MRT station will be Queenstown). We drove there so there is no problem parking at the condo carpark with ease. Went in being surprised with how spacious, relaxed and calm setting they have!

I personally really enjoy my Tuina experience with Elaine and for my partner (his first time trying out Tuina) with LeLe. Also get to try cupping for my very first time!

Also chatted a little and got to know they were previously located at Club Street and has been around for 22 years.

Thank you Amelia, Elaine and LeLe once again for the great experience!
Will recommend to others and come back again.

Place is clean and nicely decorated. The masseuse was great as well - she checked in on me from time to time, asking if the pressure was ok and if I was feeling cold. Left the place with my stiff neck, shoulders and back gaining a new lease of life!

Not a fan of tui na massages, so I asked for a gentle therapist and it was a great experience. She was skillful and attentive, constantly checking in to make sure the pressure was good and my problem areas (neck and back) was properly treated. Bought a $500 package after and have been coming back regularly.

Hardly one to do write a review but I totally feel this place deserves a good write-up - their staff are polite and I had a superb experience with Alice.

I have a desk-bound job and pretty much on my computer/phone most times thus the stiff shoulders, knots all over and Alice was very specific to target those knots (btw, my knots are really very tight and deep)

What I loved about it was that, it wasn't one of those massages that's too light, too fast or too rough - she was quick to share with me what are the problematic areas on the body.

It was a very good massage altogether and I am looking forward to my next week's appointment with Alice!

Been there a few times but tried essential oil therapy this time for the first time; very impressive, smooth and relaxing. The price of it is fair and staff are all polite and professional. Would recommend visit this nice place and to try their essential oil therapy

Ive had chronic shoulder issues for many years, and with a job that requires me to be in front of a computer regularly, I am constantly experiencing pain in my shoulders. I have tried many other Tuina places in the past, but was never able to find any therapist that can help with my pain as well as Alice has.

Ive frequented Oriental for the past 1.5 months weekly and the pain has become a lot more manageable. Alice always makes me feel at ease. Her tuinas are forceful and will not provide a relaxing session that some people might expect, but to me its necessary. I consistently feel refreshed after every session, and the discomfort in my shoulders do not return so quickly (this is something Ive noticed with other Tuina places, which suggests they might only be providing temporary relief).

The space is conveniently located, very clean, and easy to make an appointment. At $64 for a 1-hour session, their rates are also affordable and comparable to other establishments.  I will definitely recommend them, be sure to look for Alice!

I did the tuina plus the cupping therapy. They were very professional and did the massage very nicely. Would recommend it to others as well. Definitely going there for my next appointment.

My go-to tuina place for the past 1 year. Frequent this outlet at least once a month without package. Staff turnover is quite high so I always get a different masseur every time. The skills of the masseur vary so it's really a hit or miss if you don't have a regular one, but out of 15 times visited- it's about 30% of the time I got a less skillful massage experience, the rest was fine

They have 2 outlets- with the smaller one at tiong baru and the rooms there are also more squeezy.

Rooms are quite clean however they only have a mixed toilet in the premise so gotta queue up during peak hours.

Recommend to book if you are coming during the weekends!
