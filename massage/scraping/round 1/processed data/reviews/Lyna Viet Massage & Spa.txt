I wish there was an option to give more than 5 stars to this place. BEST FOOT MASSAGE i have ever received by Simon here. I was feeling like walking on  clouds after that foot massage. Absolutely amazing! It is not a very private place therefore I have only tried foot massage here but my partner have tried full body massage as well and he was very happy with the service. The staff is very polite and they put a timer for the massage duration for complete transparency. Pricing is very reasonable too.

Great massage at a great price. Tried the 60 minute foot massage, which made me feel like walking on clouds, and the full body massage, which was 90 minutes of pure relaxation, after which i felt amazing! Can absolutely recommend, very clean and professional place.

Excellent full body massage! The hot stones and warm pillow felt amazing :) Not very private, but the price and massage makes up for it.  Will definitely try the foot massage too next time.

Really good massage, but I really hate the fact that there wasn't any privacy. I could see the person opposite and had no way of changing in the area without customers looking at me. Please improve on the privacy of each booth. I think it's best to cover up totally.

Went there after seeing all the good reviews.
Had a very relaxing full body massage at a valued price. Lack of privacy for full body massage but for this price and quality, it's okay for me.

Cindy really tries to ease all your tensions away. I feel much lighter after my massage.

For $66 and 90min, I feel it's one of the more affordable massages, however the space is cramped and tiny.

But the massage is still very good and they use hot stones and hot cushions which is very relaxing.

Just had a foot massge at Lyna Vietnam Massage & Spa. Been quite a few foot massage around this area including People's Park, and I think I found that suits my liking. The staffs was very welcoming. My masseur was called, Simon. He's a wonderful masseur and makes me feel relax. There are some bruises on my knee and he is very careful with it. At the end of the message, he applied some ointment on my bruised knee and gently rubbed on it - appreciate this little thing. I will definitely come back again !
