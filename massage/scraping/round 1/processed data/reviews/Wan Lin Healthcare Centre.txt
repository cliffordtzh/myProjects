Authentic and professional massage.
The masseur was really skillful and able to effectively relieve the tensions in my muscles, especially the tension knots around my neck and shoulders. Also, the environment was really clean and gives off a really relaxing and comfortable vibe.

Overall, a truly enjoyable massage experience. Highly recommend!

Awesome massage experience at WanLin. I wear heels and go to the gym often and was experiencing aching on my soles. I also have stiff neck as a result of poor ergonomics during WFH.

The masseuse really eased the knots in my body. Appreciated the fact that the place was really easy to locate and environment is relaxing with lots of antiques as well.

Plus point is that I can charge my phone there while I enjoy the foot massage.

Highly recommended :) !

I had a lot of muscle knots and stiffness in my back and shoulders which the masseuse was able to rub them out. Been to quite a few massage places before but many of them werent able to fully rub them out for me. For once, I didnt even have to ask the masseuse to use strength and he was able to rub them out properly with the right amount of strength. He was able to isolate and pin point my affected areas without even telling him about it. Sadly, I didn't get his name as I had to rush off. Overall, I wasn't expecting anything but I think Ive found my new go-to massage place now :) The service was great and the masseuse kept asking me if the strength was okay. 10/10 recommend

We did 40-min foot reflexology and 20-min shoulder + back massage with 2 female masseuses and it was amazing, relieving us of our feet, neck and shoulder aches. The environment is clean and comfortable too and I foresee returning for regular sessions. That said, my friend and I realised that our masseuses both appeared exhausted working through the evening, and one mentioned they didn't have time to go for proper meals that day. As much as I like the ease of having multiple time slots to book online, it'd be nice to see well-rested masseuses with sufficient break and meal times. Perhaps the management could look into improving the welfare of their masseuses. Happy workers, happy vibes for customers too.

Took a 60min full body massage and was assigned a masseur. Masseur was knowledgeable, hands were strong, technique was good as well. Masseur focused more on my neck as I have a very stiff neck and shoulder. Will be back next time to focus on my lower back. Highly recommended!

Very good masseur can be found here, had a 1 hour body massage with Lin. She is so good and experience, and helped to relieve for all the tension i believe i had in my muscles or whole body. She can literally pinpoint the areas that need more attention in after i mentioned the pains i had during massage. Had a very good sleep thereafter. Highly recommended. Thank you Lin =)

My go-to massage place. My mom is a regular here and was the one who introduced me to this joint after some of my bad experiences at some other local massage chains. I go to school nearby and came here one day after a horrible 4-hour headache that left me in agony throughout my entire lecture-filled day. A quick 1-hour session with a request for the auntie who did my massage to focus on my tense back and neck did MAGIC. I swear.

I come here now with my bf who is a chef and on his feet all day, and he feels rejuvenated after a quick hour rubdown. I'd honestly give more stars if I could. Reasonable prices and skilled therapists and super convenient location as well.

Overall, I had a seamless experience! I also found the pricing to be very reasonable, shop was easy to locate as well.

Firstly, I was received by the staff with a warm welcome! The environment was clean and comfortable. I had a 40min foot massage + 20min shoulder massage - my masseuse (Esther) was warm, skilled and adjusted pressure to my preference.

Theres just one part I felt could be improved, I had to walk on the malls floor barefoot after taking off my shoes, into the shop. Maybe some carpets/slippers could be placed at the entrance to enhance this experience. That would make everything perfect!

Did a 40mins foot + 20mins shoulder massage today and its awesome!! I usually dont do foot massage as my pain tolerance is not that high. The masseur adjusted his pressure to my comfort and i even fell asleep! Will definitely come back again, thanks!

Went for full body massage, told the masseuse I had neck and back injury before hence the muscles there were stiff. And told her to apply light pressure to these areas.

All went well with my back. She applied light pressure and loosened out the knots just fine.

But for my neck, she went crazy. The first thing she did was take one finger and jab it very hard into the back of my neck (the area between neck and head). The pain was intense. It radiated to the back of my eye and side of my head. The whole night, my neck, head and eye, were aching. Today is the 2nd day, and these areas are still painful. I hope she did not do lasting damage to any nerves.

While she probably meant well, I think she needs to pay better attention to her customers needs. And learn how to massage properly instead of just jabbing really hard.

My first time going for this kind of massage and it was really amazing.
Zi Co massaged me and I experienced the foot and shoulder massage which lasted for 1 hour.
I have back pain and when I mentioned it to him, he was able to help me out and ease my muscle tension.
I also saw there are a lot of foreign customers that came and they mentioned that they are regulars here when they come to Singapore.

Really relaxing. Thank you!

Had a very pleasant experience over at Wan Lin. Masseuse was very friendly and good at his craft. The environment is very relaxing as well. You can change into their clothes so dont worry about wearing long sleeve and jeans. Definitely will recommend if youre looking for a good local massage place.

Booked in advance and did a 40 min foot massage and 20 min shoulder massage. The location was convenient and in town. I like how it is efficient, no waiting time and staffs are friendly. The masseuse asked me for my preference of the degree of pressure for the massage. Love it and will definitely recommend to my friends!

Went there for a session on the 03 June 2019 at 1945hrs. Booking through the website was seamless and the massage store is clean and professional. I went for the package which consist of 40 minutes foot massage and 20 minutes shoulder massage. Jenny was my masseuse and she was very experienced and skilful with the blood circulation points () which provided me with a very relaxing experience. Before the session, my leg felt extremely tensed and heavy but after the session, it felt more relaxed and light. Amazing experience here and the only thing that i regretted for the session is not opting for a longer session!

Thank you Wan Lin for the wonderful experience!

Cheers,
Shixin :)

I had a 60-minute full body massage done by Tina. Her technique was really good, she pressed at all the right points and with just the right amount of strength. All my aches just disappeared afterwards. Honestly, it was better than most of the massages I have gotten in Thailand, especially in terms of technique. The ambiance was relaxing and the price is very affordable too! Would definitely go back for more. Tip for others is to book a slot on their website early because the place is usually quite packed.

Wan Lin has the best masseurs and masseuses in Singapore. I had a pleasant half-body massage session, where the masseuse knew where my hardened knots and pains are, and automatically massaged these parts more. She even explained the causes, and recommended some of the poor habits that resulted in body aches. I suggest this healthcare centre to everyone needing a massage, as my whole body relieved after my session!

Went there for a session on the 03 June 2019 at 1945hrs with my boyfriend after a long day at work where my body and legs are sore.

I went for the package which consist of 40 minutes foot massage and 20 minutes shoulder massage together with my boyfriend and June was assigned to me. June was extremely patient and experienced while providing me with the massage and i appreciate her effort for constantly checking with me if the pressure applied was fine. The entire session was extremely soothing and relaxing and June was extremely great with the pressure points with my foot and shoulders. After the session, all the soreness was gone and i felt extremely relieved. The shop in general is very clean and well-equipped with entertainment facilities such as TVs and hot towels to clean your feet. I definitely will recommend you guys to come try it out after a long day of shopping at Bugis Street!

Thank you Wan Lin for the wonderful experience!

With love,
Jermane

I had really bad muscle aches on my legs. Tried to search for foot massage around the vicinity and saw quite a number of good review. Decided to try and I was really amazed by the masseur's massage skill. Kenny really knows what he is doing and my legs feel so much better. 38 dollars for 60 mins. Reasonable price. Will definitely come back again when I need another fix for my legs. :)

Everything was excellent! The staff were very welcoming; the beds were soft; the masseuse (Jenny) was strong and pressed at all the right pressure points and even the payment was convenient since they accept paynow. It was a much needed massage after a stressful week at work. It really helped me to de-stress and relax my muscles. I got the full body massage for 60 minutes and it was surprisingly very affordable. I would highly recommend making a booking early especially if you have a particular masseuse in mind. It was very convenient to do the booking on my phone and I could even choose the masseuse I wanted. Jennys schedule can be quite packed so I suggest booking early.
