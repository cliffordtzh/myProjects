Took a grab here in a rush as I was afraid that I would be late. Arrived early but had to wait for my appointment timing. Was greeted by the front-desk manager. Place is cosy, clean and very private. Small little cosy front shop that opens up to many rooms inside. My therapist Chloe was very friendly,  very polite and had very soothing hands. All in all a very relaxing massage.

Hi. Firstly, The place really lives up to its name. I would like compliment one of the therapist. I had a Hot Oil Massage session with Isha on New Year's Day at 8pm. All i can say is she is great at what she is doing. She can sense that my body was super tense and she just knew how much pressure to apply and what technique to use. She even managed to resolve the problem i had with my right shoulder. I would definitely come back for more sessions at Fave Spa.

Had a appointment with therapist Paris. She is a very pleasant, cheerful and polite girl that always served with a smile. During the massage, she is very efficient, professional and hardworking. She ensure me by constantly asking me whether everything was okay and I was very well being taken care of. I was actually wowed by skills despite her youth. Overall, I would have rated her above 5 stars if have the selection.

Was massage by Cherrie, she was a nice masseuse which is very professional in every ways in asking light/heavy massage. Taking care of all small details during the session. Front desk Kelly service was good, being nice to suggest suitable massage. Fave spa condition is clean and adhere to all the health requirement

Had a very relaxing experience at Fave Spa.  The place was very cosy and clean and I was warmly received by the receptionist.  My therapist Angela was very sweet and polite.  I was having very bad body ache after cycling and Angela was able to relax my body with her excellent massage skills.  I will definitely come back.  Highly recommended.  You deserve all the 5 stars!

 Brenda *****Highly recommended to get your massage from Brenda. 5 Star for her massage, she is experienced and knows where are the meridian point on my back, neck and shoulder for fatigue releasing and body relaxing. Feeling refresh and stress free after the massage. Will have a good night sleep tonight and keep fighting for another day.
Definitely will come back again to find Brenda. Not to mention the receptionist is very polite and accommodating as well when I'm waiting. I think Fave spa have done so much to ensure all customer will have a pleasant and safe time while enjoying the massage there. Cheeersss!

Had been visiting Fave Spa for quite some time was always welcomed warmly by the friendly receptionist, Kelly. Place is very clean and cosy too.

Mandy is one of the massage therapist there and is my go-to massage therapist, her skills are definitely one of the best. She would constantly ask if pressure applied is ok and focus on areas that requires more attention.

Overall, i would definitely recommend Fave Spa to anyone who wants to have a relaxed and enjoyable time.

I have been a loyal customer of Nico bee since I know her. She is friendly and caring masseur towards her customers. Her massage skills  is not only tip top but also a caring massuer. Never met such a polite and cheerful massuer in other spa. Keep up the good work.

First time visiting fave spa and was warmly greeted by Kelly and Lyn, making me feel welcome and took care of me as it was raining. They recommended Brenda whose massage skills are out of this world and despite being from China could speak English. Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to coming again.

Had a relaxing massage session with therapist Vera. Her massage skill is to the point and skillful. She constantly adjusted the pressure to my needs, and relieve my muscles quite a bit, especially after a long tiring day at work. I will definitely return for another session in the near future.
