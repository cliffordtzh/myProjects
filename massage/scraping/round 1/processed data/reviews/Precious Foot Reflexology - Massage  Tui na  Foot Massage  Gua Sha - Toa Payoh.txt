It's my very first massage experience here. I was warmly welcomed by a friendly and spontenous lady, introduced herself as Linda.  Front desk counter linda is professional, prompt and quick to attend to customers. Even though the place is almost full, she is very professional, always carry a smiling face. The Chinese massue did an awesome job! Had a 2 hour body massage with Sandalwood Essential Oil. Massaue's techniques are really excellent. Room is clean and tidy with soothing music. Definitely will return for massage again!

Went there first time after seeing some good reviews and did not disappoint! Jackson was explaining in detail the different parts of foot massage linking to the bdifferent body parts. He's very skilled and did not
just use brute forces like some other massage place. No hard sell, will recommend! Thanks for the great massage!

Chanced upon this gem on google and requested for Jackson due to the many good reviews here. On my first visit, my main concern was to resolve my excruciating daily migraine which recently worsened. 1 week later, my migraine is almost 90 percent cured. Today was my second visit and I opted for the 2 hour body therapy addon 0.5 hrs to slim my bloated and protruding tummy due to stagnated qi and water. And to my astonishment, he managed to flatten my tummy significantly within half an hour. It has never been so flat in 2 years! Another thing which amazes me is that he is able to pinpoint and target problem areas instantly, instead of the systematic steps (123, abc) monotonous massages offered in many other places.

Great massage experience! My assigned masseur was Mr. Chong and he was professional and polite. I really enjoyed my 1 hour foot massage. The 3 very friendly ladies at the counter were very courteous as well! Love the cosy environment! Keep it up!

I would highly recommend massuer Jackson from TP outlet. He is so experienced in his skills that I feel very comfortable & relaxed when he massages my legs & feet. He doesn't make it painful for me and uses the right strength & acupressure to help resolve my issue of poor blood circulation. I can say that definitely my legs feel much better after each message session. Thks Jackson.

This is my first Visit to this outlet due to neck strain and purchased 45 mins for neck shoulder treatment. Jackson is very good masseur and help to resolve my issue. He also identified that I have vertigo in which I did not even realised myself (I do have height phobia + easily get dizziness) His acupressure skills were good and no need to apply medicated oil. Will look for him again to resolve my vertigo issue! Price there is reasonable!

I have been a patron of this massage center. Most masseurs are good and provide comfortable massages (foot massage is highly recommended). One particular masseur (Jackson) has good skill for head and shoulder massage.

Had a massage from Jackson. I went to do a massage with ba guan as I suddenly lost hearing on left ear. I tried ENT and ate steroids. Just feel like to try tcm way. Surprisingly after Jackson's ba guan, I recover on the next day. Strongly recommend Jackson. He is good and experienced.

Is quite a good experience for me & my mother in law. Weve enjoyed it so much for our 60mins foot + 30mins neck & shoulder. My masseuse Jackson & my mother in law have met a malay masseuse really help alot to soothe the stiffness of our foot & shoulder.

Jackson is a very excellent and professional therapist. I have experienced long period of lower back pain. He has resolved all of my problems. High recommending him.

Blessings to Jackson. I came here because of the google reviews, thought Id take a chance. My legs were swollen, and for weeks Ive felt fatigue, lack of energy. Jackson was amazing, he knew most of the issues I had and after the foot reflexology I felt so much better. Very healing! Thank you so much!!

It was the worst massage I ever encountered theres ' The lady masseur does not have any technique. The pressure used was wrong, and she pinched the calf instead of pressing on them .  She doesnt have any idea what shes doing. My legs felt much more painful after visiting them. Its unfair n unethical for the shop to send an untrained masseur just cos they are busy yet want business. Disappointed

Masseurs are good. problem is the counter staff who is quite absent minded and in conflict with the masseurs sometimes which ruins the massage experience. Hard to get appointment slots from the counter lady wearing specs.

Went to do foot, neck and shoulder massage. Mr Chong is able to use the right strength and pin point to the area that I am facing issues and tips on how to make it better. Thanks Mr Chong:)

Went over a few days ago! I was searching on Google the best reflexology place nearby. I somehow injured my foot and was unwell for two weeks, had to take a lot of medicine, on bed rest for 7 days and went to the doctor 3 times.. so I finally decided to go for a foot massage to see if it would help. It has been a few days after the massage and amazingly my foot has recovered like 90%! I would like to thank Jackson so much for attending to my needs and making sure that I will heal faster and better :) He definitely knows his forte! I recommend you to ask for Jackson when you come over/or make an appointment as he really takes care of the client. He also knew the problem as soon as he started the massage. Turns out I'm just very dehydrated and also overweight haha! I really have him to thank as if it wasn't for him I would still be on MC. Didn't have any cash on me to give tips but I'll be sure to give some the next time I'm there :) Thanks so much, he's a keeper, I hope you'll give him a raise! (Went to the TPY Outlet)

I suppose to feedback 2 to 3 weeks ago.
I went to this place 4 times already . Each time the service is always good.  The last time I went is a Saturday with my sister. The lady that handle me is very good . At the end of the session I ask for her name. She told me she is Teresa, I was surprise as I knew the boss of this company is Ms Teresa . I am so lucky abs thank her for the services.
This place the staff is very good in massage . They have package but they never hard sales , this is the best part.
I will continue to support this place. On the outside it look like a small place but they have 2nd level with lots of room.
The boss and staff all have good skill and the place is comfortable .

Good service, felt the tension release with the massage strokes.

PS - minused one star because they made customers input 5 stars for the review.

Had the best reflexology here with my therapist, Albert. He really focused on the pain points of my feet, and spent time to fix them. Really rare for any reflexology session, which is usually more of an overall comforting massage. My foot and back feels so much looser and lighter now. Highly recommend!

Uncle Richard is the best. He is 70 but is stronger than me. He is highly skilled and really loves his job. I felt renewed after coming out after foot, shoulder and neck massage. This place is highly recommended.

Nice quaint establishment with great overall atmosphere.
Masseur's skill (rani) was excellent - very experienced and able to press with a good amount of pressure to relieve pain points.
Service was great as well. Make sure to book an appointment beforehand, especially on weekends.

I went to their outlet in Toa Payoh many times. Each time was attended by different staff. Their skill are very good

Went 3 weeks ago and was attended by a lady. Her skill is very good especially the back and head massage.

After asking her name than I realized she is the boss of the place.

The outlet have 2 level and the 2nd level with lots of room. So far this is the place I like most with good skill abs environment is clean and comfortable. They also not hard sales their package.

Will continue to support. You can book Thru  their webpage and will have some discount
