She worked on the exact spots in my back and neck that needed it. She is great at relieving tension without transferring it to other parts of body. I would rather my money go to the massage therapist rather than a big company.
Overall  it was a great experience!

This is the second time i experience the service from Soul massage Singapore at the comfort of my home. I truly recommend for anyone to try their home services, the therapist is professional, my favorite is Emma. She is good and gave the correct strong pressure point. I had a back pain and super stiff neck as i mostly sat down and do many zoom meetings in a day. So her massage had been helping me to calm down and relax. I usually ask for night session, so it will help and drift me to a goodnight sleep. Thank you!
