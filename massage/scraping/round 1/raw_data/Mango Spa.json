        "nicholas CYR Wong\n1 review\u00b712 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTucked away away from the rows of restaurants and cafes, Mango Spa on Greendale was a welcome change and great find! I had an hour to spare and tried their body massage and it was wonderful and so de-stressfully relaxing. I also appreciated the use of strength and intensity to \u201cpush and press away\u201d the knots and kinks I had been feeling over the weeks. Professional and attentive. Great job! Will be back and will recommend them to family and friends. Thanks! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n",

        "caryn kor\n5 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nIt didn\u2019t feel professional. It felt like one of those cheap massages where they presses really hard on every area of your body without any skill or technique. But they charge more than the usual massage service. They couldn\u2019t issue official receipt which was a bit strange.\n\n",
