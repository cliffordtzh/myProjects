        "Sherry Lim\n9 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nShe worked on the exact spots in my back and neck that needed it. She is great at relieving tension without transferring it to other parts of body. I would rather my money go to the massage therapist rather than a big company.\nOverall  it was a great experience!\n\n",
        "Priscilla Pank\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis is the second time i experience the service from Soul massage Singapore at the comfort of my home. I truly recommend for anyone to try their home services, the therapist is professional, my favorite is Emma. She is good and gave the correct strong pressure point. I had a back pain and super stiff neck as i mostly sat down and do many zoom meetings in a day. So her massage had been helping me to calm down and relax. I usually ask for night session, so it will help and drift me to a goodnight sleep. Thank you!\n\n",
        "Kiasu Tshirt\n5 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nOnly eager to get the deposit. Cancelled last minute. A couple massage that too. Which was a special birthday surprise.\n\n",
