        "hakasson\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt's my very first massage experience here. I was warmly welcomed by a friendly and spontenous lady, introduced herself as Linda.  Front desk counter linda is professional, prompt and quick to attend to customers. Even though the place is almost full, she is very professional, always carry a smiling face. The Chinese massue did an awesome job! Had a 2 hour body massage with Sandalwood Essential Oil. Massaue's techniques are really excellent. Room is clean and tidy with soothing music. Definitely will return for massage again!\n\n",
        "Guay Gen Phua\n5 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent there first time after seeing some good reviews and did not disappoint! Jackson was explaining in detail the different parts of foot massage linking to the bdifferent body parts. He's very skilled and did not\njust use brute forces like some other massage place. No hard sell, will recommend! Thanks for the great massage!\n\n",
        "Natalie Tay\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nChanced upon this gem on google and requested for Jackson due to the many good reviews here. On my first visit, my main concern was to resolve my excruciating daily migraine which recently worsened. 1 week later, my migraine is almost 90 percent cured. Today was my second visit and I opted for the 2 hour body therapy addon 0.5 hrs to slim my bloated and protruding tummy due to stagnated qi and water. And to my astonishment, he managed to flatten my tummy significantly within half an hour. It has never been so flat in 2 years! Another thing which amazes me is that he is able to pinpoint and target problem areas instantly, instead of the systematic steps (123, abc) monotonous massages offered in many other places.\n\n",

        "jaswinder kaur\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI would highly recommend massuer Jackson from TP outlet. He is so experienced in his skills that I feel very comfortable & relaxed when he massages my legs & feet. He doesn't make it painful for me and uses the right strength & acupressure to help resolve my issue of poor blood circulation. I can say that definitely my legs feel much better after each message session. Thks Jackson.\n\n",
        "Roseanne Peh\n11 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis is my first Visit to this outlet due to neck strain and purchased 45 mins for neck shoulder treatment. Jackson is very good masseur and help to resolve my issue. He also identified that I have vertigo in which I did not even realised myself (I do have height phobia + easily get dizziness) His acupressure skills were good and no need to apply medicated oil. Will look for him again to resolve my vertigo issue! Price there is reasonable!\n\n",
        "Wong Teck Jung\nLocal Guide\u00b7197 reviews\u00b7327 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI have been a patron of this massage center. Most masseurs are good and provide comfortable massages (foot massage is highly recommended). One particular masseur (Jackson) has good skill for head and shoulder massage.\n\n",

My legs were swollen, and for weeks I\u2019ve felt fatigue, lack of energy. Jackson was amazing, he knew most of the issues I had and after the foot reflexology I felt so much better. Very healing! Thank you so much!!\n\n",
        "Bell Flower\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nIt was the worst massage I ever encountered theres ' The lady masseur does not have any technique. The pressure used was wrong, and she pinched the calf instead of pressing on them .  She doesn\u2019t have any idea what she\u2019s doing. My legs felt much more painful after visiting them. It\u2019s unfair n unethical for the shop to send an untrained masseur just cos they are busy yet want business. Disappointed \ud83d\ude21\n\n",
        "Edward Lee W Y\n3 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nMasseurs are good. problem is the counter staff who is quite absent minded and in conflict with the masseurs sometimes which ruins the massage experience. Hard to get appointment slots from the counter lady wearing specs.\n\n",
        "Jacyln Tan\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent to do foot, neck and shoulder massage. Mr Chong is able to use the right strength and pin point to the area that I am facing issues and tips on how to make it better. Thanks Mr Chong:)\n\n",
        "Syafiqah Suhaimi\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent over a few days ago! I was searching on Google the best reflexology place nearby. I somehow injured my foot and was unwell for two weeks, had to take a lot of medicine, on bed rest for 7 days and went to the doctor 3 times.. so I finally decided to go for a foot massage to see if it would help. It has been a few days after the massage and amazingly my foot has recovered like 90%! I would like to thank Jackson so much for attending to my needs and making sure that I will heal faster and better :) He definitely knows his forte! I recommend you to ask for Jackson when you come over/or make an appointment as he really takes care of the client. He also knew the problem as soon as he started the massage. Turns out I'm just very dehydrated and also overweight haha! I really have him to thank as if it wasn't for him I would still be on MC. Didn't have any cash on me to give tips but I'll be sure to give some the next time I'm there :) Thanks so much, he's a keeper, I hope you'll give him a raise! (Went to the TPY Outlet)\n\n",

        "Victoria Huang\n5 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad the best reflexology here with my therapist, Albert. He really focused on the pain points of my feet, and spent time to fix them. Really rare for any reflexology session, which is usually more of an overall comforting massage. My foot and back feels so much looser and lighter now. Highly recommend!\n\n",
        "Sanskar D. Verma\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nUncle Richard is the best. He is 70 but is stronger than me. He is highly skilled and really loves his job. I felt renewed after coming out after foot, shoulder and neck massage. This place is highly recommended.\n\n",
