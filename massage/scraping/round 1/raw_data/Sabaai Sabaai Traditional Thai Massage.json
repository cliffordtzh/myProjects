        "Lilian Tan\n7 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nChanced upon this place while looking for massages nearby and picked it solely based on the high Google review ratings. Best decision made! Tried the Thai Aroma massage which has four scents to choose from, and the masseuse really worked hard on those knots in my back \ud83d\ude06 my whole body felt so relieved after 90 min! The staff were really friendly and the place was well decorated. Price is a bit higher than some other common massage parlours I think (?) but totally worth it. Already planning the next trip, and thinking of getting a package \ud83e\udd2d looking forward to going back there soon!\n\n",
        "SL\n4 reviews\u00b713 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWas trawling through reddit for some good places to get a massage and chanced upon this gem. It was defs worth the price and the good reviews! Went for the Thai Signature with my partner and we both loved it. He commented that he would 100% recommend it and he found the massage comprehensive with excellent back manipulation \ud83d\ude0d Just as other commenters remarked, our masseuses managed to hit the right spots with just the right amount of pressure.\n\nMy masseuse (Sophia) was really strong and responsive to my verbal/non-verbal cues. We will definitely be back for more!\n\n",
        "Chia Joel\nLocal Guide\u00b7282 reviews\u00b74,421 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOne of the best thai massage places you can find here in singapore.\n\nSuper clean place - nice robes for you to change into, toilet though a bit small was clean - had kirei kirei!\n\nThough prices are a little premium as compared to overseas or in JB. You really get a quality full body thai traditional Thai massage that will leave you wanting more.\n\nThey have a chop system as well as you can collect and get discounts if you are a loyal returning customer...\n\nDefinitely book a slot and try it for yourself!\n\n75 for an hour of Thai traditional massage!\n\nOnly bummer is that somehow their payment system doesn't accept contactless paywave options and you have to bring your physical credit card if you'll like to use your credit card to pay!\n\n",

        "Aer V\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHighly recommended. The masseuse I had, Li Ping, was very skillful. She was very attentive and was able to find the accurate spots I was having problems with. I had 1hr Traditional Thai + 2hrs Aroma massage. Was a great combo to get rid of all body aches and stiffness. Will definitely return again.\n\n",

        "CHAE U RI LEE\n2 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI took \u201c30 minutes/ foot massage. \u201c\n\nI'd like to make a reservation at 8 pm. But at 7:13 pm the massage club called me and said \u201c8 pm is full booking, so I have to come by 7:30 pm.\u201d\n\nI called on time without being late. I visited at the time they wanted, hoping for better service. (If they had at least the average massage level, I wouldn't have written this review.)\n\nAt The first time it wasn't bad. (Greeting service, beverage service etc..)\nDesk staff were friendly and beverage service was good. And the tea was also good.\n\u2014\n< Foot Massage started. >\n\n* massage\nThe first pressure to me for left foot massage was weak and insincere.\nI majored in art, knows a little bit of anatomy. Also Massage experience is a lot as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the pressure is too weak to a viable level for baby. (This is not a massage, just touching.)\n\nBut I did not say any compliments at first.\n\nBecause I thought there will be the therapist\u2019s intention or purpose of the first time introduction stage and still believe.....\n\n15 minutes left. To be honest, At that time feel bad. (There\u2019s no therapist\u2019s intention or purpose. She just... It became apparent that the time was being spent by forcefully.)\n\nBut the therapist condition is good or thought there may be many other reasons.. So I told her\nsoftly, just \u201cpress more than the left foot.\u201d\n\nThe right foot was better than the left touch level. I'm not satisfied with my right side, but I'm just touching my left foot.\n\nI thought I waste of money and time.\n\nNo difference whatsoever after the massage are tired of the foot and calf.\n\n< 5 minutes left. >\n\nI saw a new guest wash her by other therapist.\n\nSo I ask the my therapist.\n\n\u201cWhy I never wash my feet like her?\u201d\nThen my therapist replied.\n\u201cBecause I am taking a half-hour massage. And\nthis massage is not included the washing feet service. So I took just wash your feet as a wet towel.\nIf you want to wash your feet service,\nYou have to pay an additional $ 10. Would you take a feet washing service?\n\nThe massage was only five minutes remaining in. (Also, If the foot service is not to be included in a 30-minute period, the massage club or therapist should have made the announcement beforehand.)\n\nWast time and money...\n\nIf I was satisfied with today, I would visit again tomorrow with my friend, but I never will. Never go.\n\n",

        "WenD Tan\nLocal Guide\u00b7460 reviews\u00b71,231 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nUpdate on 6/3/18 : price has increased to $80 for Thai massage. Didn\u2019t inquire about massage. Still  reasonable pricing. Previous review: $68 for 60mins. Jasmine: recommend for females (medium strength) Great masseur, know what she's doing. Went for traditional Thai massage (no oil) and she helped relieved many knots which I didn't even know I had! Bought a package for $620 (10 times) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\n",
        "Constance Yeo\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat place for Traditional Thai Massage. Went on a Sunday evening. Very serene and comfortable. My masseuse was Zhang Qin. I walked in with back aches and walked out with none. They are good at identifying the pressure points to release the pains.\n\n"
