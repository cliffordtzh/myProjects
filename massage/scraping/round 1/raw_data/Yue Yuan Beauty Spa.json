        "Musho Pea\nLocal Guide\u00b71,123 reviews\u00b76,370 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDisturbed by some of these reviews, I asked for someone strong and got ah mei. She is chatty but will seek your feedback to adjust her pressure level. She's definitely strong and knows the pressure points and immediately spots knots to smooth them out! I chose to tolerate the pain and emerged feeling more loose and relaxed.\n\nEdit: place is kinda rundown and don't forget to check Aircon temperature if you feel hot.\n\n",
        "Jaycob Vanderson\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nHorrible place. Avoid like a plague. Walked pass their spa after having supper in the area and decided to give it a shot. Right from the start the counter staff consistently pushed for the higher priced package claiming it is the best and most common one that their customers choose. I conceded as I was in need of a massage.\n\nSubsequently, the massage was absolutely horrendous, the worst massage i have ever received from any spa. My masseuse was simply arbitrarily tapping all over my body, as if she was playing the piano, completely devoid of skill or technique. To make matters worse, she consistently fell asleep throughout the massage. At one point she sat on the chair and had her head on my back completely motionless for a good 3-4 minutes and after i woke her up and asked what is happening she said she is too tired. Thereafter, i when to the reception to ask for a partial refund or change of masseuse but the male receptionist simply said \"sorry nothing can be done\".\n\nIt is a given that sometimes it is a matter of luck on whether you receive a good masseuse. But shouldn't any respectable establishment train all of their staff to adhere to basic customer service? Fervently avoid unless you want to play a game of masseuse roulette, leaving it to chance on whether you will get a decent masseuse.\n\n",
        "Orion Beltin\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nActually the worst massage i have ever received. It appears that their masseuse are untrained and simply unskilled. This spa is almost akin to a  scam whereby the reception will constantly try to upsell you in exchange for a horrible experience. An automatic massage chair can provide a much better massage experience than this place ever can. Also, seems like their 5 star reviews are bogus ratings created by their own people.\n\n",

        "Lester Poon Yu Da\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nFirst and foremost, don\u2019t go to this spa if you want to have a peaceful massage without being upsell.\n\n2nd.. I was told that when I signed up for the 90 mins package, will be given either gua sha or ba guan. But end up none of it was given. When I asked the front desk lady, she said I have to tell the masseuse myself but when I ask the masseuse, she said she wasn\u2019t told to provide that service.\n\n3rd, aircon was spoilt in the room, I was perspiring half way into my 90 mins massage.\n\nOverall if there is a negative star, I will not be hesitate to provide it...Terrible place to massage in. Totally wasted my $80 bucks\n\n",
        "Jones Ng\nLocal Guide\u00b7193 reviews\u00b71,308 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThe first time today I met a masseuse who has the worst skill. Totally strengthless, very slowly and can even stopped. It just like touching your feet only and she herself can even fell asleep while doing job. I felt wasting of my time and money. My last time to come here. Forgot to say I was here for a foot massage.\n\n",
        "Tuan Ting\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nhad a East malaysian lady Liza massagiing me today. she is customer centric and spends a lot of time on where i ache the most. massage was good and strong. had to extend half hour to soothe my tired neck, shoulder and legs. will definitely go back again\n\n",
        "Vicissitude24\nLocal Guide\u00b769 reviews\u00b7558 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\n2 november 2016: I just went here last week, the staff are great. of course it is not like the expensive place that is spaceous, but if you are looking for a great massage with an decent price, this is the right place to be. They got steam bath offered to you. Massage is wonderful, although most of them speak chinese, the receptionist can speak english and you can give your instructions if you got certain areas you want to focus on.\n\nI am coming back again as I learned to love the place and finally found a permanent massage place for me.\n\n",
        "Wayne Fitzgibbons\n10 reviews\u00b714 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nDO NOT COME HERE. Waste of time and money. Touch as soft as a baby, asked to massage lower back but kept rubbing shoulders. All the tile talking to other girls. Didn\u2019t wipe off oil or tell me she had finished, just walked away.\nComplete junk.\n\n",
        "Ng Robett\n4 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nI very sad why they did not cook the green bean desert which is my favourite.  I hope they will resume cooking this desert very soothing for a massage.\nThe TV was spoiled for so long n no action taken to resolve it.  Very poor service to we customers.\nI will come back if those things are rectify promptly. Thanks.\nRobert.\n\n",

        "Chanleo Chanleo\n10 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nPrice is reasonable but just never accept credit card. Its cash, nets or mastercard.\nThe masseurs were skilled depending on who.\nEnvironment is clean and not sleazy.\n\n",
