        "asyid scorpio\nLocal Guide\u00b757 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nEnvironment ok. But when we go to spa we want to feel relax. Enjoy the tenderly massage techniques. Especially when you book the right massue. You will feel at ease. The tiredness gone. Ache and discomfort suddenly gone. I have visited the place several times. But today, I finally managed to book the right massue. Her name is Aira. Looks n figure not important. She is a simple gal having good hands/fingers.The way she massage. The pressure point techniques. I really really enjoy the massage done by her... She really knows how to apply the firmness during massages. She is friendly too. I gave her 5 star. Fully recommended. Great job Aira. I will visit the place again and book her again and again n again as long she is working there. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n",

        "Joanna Oh\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWent on Sunday and had a very poor experience.\nThe masseuse was indifferent to how I felt even though I feedbacked many times it was very painful. She gave many unprofessional comments about how it is normal to be painful because of my body.\n\nI developed body aches and even a fever of 38.4 degrees after the massage.\n\nAvoid this place. Worst massage experience ever for me.\n\n",
        "Stanley Gan\n1 review\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nWent for a Japanese massage 1hour 30min $142 very relaxing and comfortable almost felt asleep.\nJust when I about to felt asleep, the therapist asked if I want to add another $80 for extra service.\nSo is it very relaxing but also very expensive spa, hopefully next time can have some promotions on the extra service.\n\n",
