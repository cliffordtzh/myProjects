        "ZW Fatty\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGrandeur Spa is my regular go to place due to the nice ambience and friendly staffs. Just had another session with my regular masseuse Fara. Fara is skillful and very experience in her massage. She is very soft spoken and knows how to make you relax and enjoy the massage session. Though petite but she applies enough strength to your body especially on those pressure points to release the muscle tension. Be sure to come back weekly for my regular massage. Also would like to compliment to Elise and Meimei the friendly receptionist, good job. What I love most about this place is they are very attentive to you and most importantly the masseuse does not play with phone and gives you 110% attention. Thanks again Fara for the amazing massage therapy, Elise and Mei Mei for the  good hospitality.\n\n",

        "David Jones\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI discovered this gem of a spa conveniently near my home and walked in for my first massage. The ambience was pleasantly relaxing and signing in was efficient and professional.\nI was attended to by Elsa who gave me a wonderful relaxing massage. Elsa is suprisingly strong for such a tiny girl and can provide whichever pressure you prefer. Good technique and left me feeling very satisified. Will definitely choose Elsa again for my next visit.\n\n",

        "Silvia The\n11 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nA bit disappointment of the service after reading many good reviews. The massage did not take place 1 hour..i guess its around 45 mins as i need to wait them change the bedsheet. I was just getting massage on the back, without having massage in front of my body.. However, i give 3 star due to the good skill of massage therapist as she know the spots which my back aches..\n\n",

        "Edi Kay\n1 review\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVisited Grandeur after a couple of weeks of hard work that took a toll on the back and shoulders. Booked a slot and was assigned Fara.\n\nFara has strong hands, good fingers, elbows and feet that walked all over my back. Squeezing out all the lactic acids that have accumulated over working the past weeks.  Joints, neck and head were all relieved.\n\nAfter the 90 min session, I was refreshed. Standing taller with the accumulated aches and pains all soothed out. Will visit her again soon.\n\n",
        "EUGENE PANG\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI would like to give special thanks to my regular therapist Fara. She is friendly and also skilled. Although petite in size but she her massage is strong and also knows the exact spots to ease my aching body after a long day at work. I would rate her a 10/10 for massage and also for professionalism. 60 mins isn\u2019t enough for a session, would recommend to go for at least a 90 mins session where you can relax and feel refreshed after the massage. Definitely a go to place for a great massage as the other places which I have been too just massage terribly ending with a worst body ache after or the massage therapist would plays with their phone and sometimes end even before the 60 or 90 mins duration. Thanks for the nice ambience and also the great massage from Fara. Will definitely be back and to recommend more customers.\n\n",
        "Tony Neo\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTotally enjoyed my massage today by Elsa. She\u2019s efficient but gets all the right spots. Left feeling super relaxed. Will be back to look for Elsa again.\n\n",

        "Jason Ang\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent to Grandeur Spa after seeing good reviews for it. Location was a little inconvenient but the ambience is quite comfortable. I took the $89 massage. The masseus who served me was Elsa. Elsa was very good with her hands and was able to converse proficiently in Chinese so I was able to tell her which areas of my body were sore. Overall, I was very satisfied with Elsa's service and will definitely return again regularly to look for Elsa. Keep up the good work!\n\n",
