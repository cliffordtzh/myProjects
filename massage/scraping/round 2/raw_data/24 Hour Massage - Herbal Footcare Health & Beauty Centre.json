She took 1hr full foot while i took 30 min foot + 30 min shoulder/body.\nThere is offer price of $42 so its value for money. But that's not the key point.\n\nThe chinese guy who pressed for me. His name is ru ping #42 he just came from china since 10 days ago. I have to say his skill meets my requirement and taste and my stiffness is not easy to handle not many meet my expectations. \u5f88\u5230\u5473!\n\nWill come back for more!!!\n\n",

        "Shuh F\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nRandomly walked past with my husband and decided to try their 30min foot massage ($20). My husband topped up $18 for a 15min neck, shoulder and arm massage. While the place was pretty ordinary, the massages turned out great. Can tell that the masseuses (we got two men) cared about what they were doing and were explaining to us what our pain points meant. Very friendly staff. No hard selling at all. Felt rejuvenated after our session.\n\n",
        "Matan Weissman\n29 reviews\u00b767 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis place isn't very well known, but it is great. My parents visited this place 7+ years ago and yesterday I went there too for my shoulder and neck. I took the 1 hour foot+shoulder massage ($40 SG) and it was great. The employee does it strong and hard (I was in pain, which was great) and I left with almost no further strain in these areas. The next day (today) my father had his back hurting, so he took the 1 hour massage and boy is he a lot better now. 10/10!\n\n",
        "GK\n11 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVisited 17 Nov 2019. Massage is awesome with reasonable pricing but no decent covered area to change into shorts. The female masseuse have to hold a towel facing the glass panels while I change and she alert the men including the customers not to look. This is damn cheap. U can actually have a drop down curtain like area just for people to change into comfortable clothing in one corner. Even a small shop near my neighborhood market got covered area with no doors how come in town this shop runs like this. Otherwise everything else is good and relaxing for 24 hours.\n\n",
        "Victoria T\n13 reviews\u00b713 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nLoved this place and came everyday during our 5 day stay in Singapore! Friendly staff, our favourites were number 14, 27 and 19!  They were the best and so funny! Will be thinking of these foot massages back home and it truly made our trip\ud83d\ude0d\n\n",
        "Angel See\nLocal Guide\u00b733 reviews\u00b727 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI walked past today and was looking thru your services menu considering a massage. Jaffrey came up to me, was very friendly and suggested best combination cos I wanted a 90mins massage. Best value for money massage I've had in Singapore! He was very good and I feel so relaxed and rejuvenated after. I am definitely coming back again!\n\n",
        "Epi Ogden\n33 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI really like thier service and accommodation! Thier staffs are nice and also caring. Thier full body massage are completely the best but in a very very low prices. I also like the place because it plays a relaxing song! The therapist are also nice because they always asked if the pressure is fine or not. Also they have a good place and it is really peaceful it is not chaotic. I would love to go back in here if I'll be given a chance\n\n",
        "AYAKO HILLARY\n17 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI am very much regular here around 8 yrs. At the beginning, I told massage therapist about my condition. I told him especially I\u2019m tired with my head neck and shoulder. However after I fell asleep, he didn\u2019t do anything to my head then ended. I asked about to do head. He said \u201c I did\u201d but he didn\u2019t ! I talked to manager, he was freaking useless!!! I complained in front of my guest that wasn\u2019t my intention just I was embarrassed. Don\u2019t fall asleep, some guy cheat customers. I don\u2019t come back anymore, also will tell Japanese ppl what he did\n\n",
        "Rei\n5 reviews\u00b710 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nhave visited their new store and the old one over the past 3-4years. its open 24hrs and the staff are friendly, all with different methods of massaging. the location is a big plus as you can get a foot massage as a refresh after long shopping at orchard. have recommended this place to many people and they all enjoyed the experience.\n\n",
        "Zhou Dao\nLocal Guide\u00b730 reviews\u00b721 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI was being served by Jaffrey. I told him from the start that wanted to rest and yet he said he will keep me awake throughout the 30 minutes foot massage session. Indeed, he fulfilled his promise by giving me a hard time massage session claiming that I felt pain because of mt indigestion, drinking too much cold drinks and all sorts of excuses. The whole horrible massage session was witnessed by my friends who claimed that he is taking revenge on me for not striking a conversation with him. PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO STAY SILENT IF YOU ARE SERVICED BY HIM IF NOT YOU WILL GET TORTURED!!!\n\n",
        "Ressless\n5 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI took the Body Massage for 60 mins. It was a towel massage. Quite hard for my taste. I said he should do it softer but i guess he didnt heard it. Also he never adjusted, how hard and stiff my back parts or my neck was, so he just continued with it. After 30 mins he switched to easy mode and used almost no strength at my shoulders and this until 5 mins before end of the time. One day after it, i have pain and feel like i did something not healthy to my body. Wasted 50$ i think!\n\n",
        "Y Xm\nLocal Guide\u00b734 reviews\u00b794 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI took the 40mins foot reflexology and 20mins shoulder and back massage. The massage was gooood \ud83d\udc4d Costs $55.60.\n\n",
        "Lou Peter\n27 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\n\"\nIt\u2019s so nice to be here! The masseuse was so good that makes me feel really relaxed like all the pain I felt in my body was suddenly removed. Though I came here at 9:00 pm, their service is still good and their staffs are accommodating. Can\u2019t wait to come back!\"\n\n",
        "Aditya Sreekumar\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nLye was professional, with a lot of attention to detail. He genuinely cared about what he did -that made me go from a 30 minutes to a 60 minutes session. I'm definitely going to try to come back before I leave Singapore\n\n",
