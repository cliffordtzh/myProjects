        "Abdurrahman Al Asfuri Jamal\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nPositive: Professionalism\nTried this Malay masseuse YAYA! Very nice, very friendly most importantly very genuine person I ever met in massage parlour. I honestly feel 5 star isn\u2019t enough for her. You should give it a try and you won\u2019t regret. She did a legit job. And I made her my personal masseuse till she is around. God bless.! Stay safe guys \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\n\n",

        "Sherman\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTried Soul Massage for the first time. Did not make appointment prior to visit. Luckily there were open slots. Was assigned to Abby  for the massage. She was very friendly and easy to get along with; her massage managed to hit the sore spots and she has surprisingly much strength which suited how I like.\n\nPlease relay my thanks to Abby, and will definitely recommend and return for next appointment! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\n",

Ella did the hot oil massage for me, feeling all the sore and pain from not massaging a long time. Cheerful and nice to talk to. Definitely will come back again soon.\n\n",

I love the oil essence they used to freshen up the place.\nCheryl was my masseuse and she was really good. The amount of strength used on me was to my liking and she also asked where I felt tired. Very friendly and made me feel at ease.\nWill definitely come back again to look for Cheryl!\n\n",
        "Charles Tan\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time going to this outlet, didn\u2019t have any preference for therapist and was assigned Yoyo who recommended the hot oil massage.\n\nWhilst her looks differs a lot from the (obviously photoshopped) photo, her massage strength and skill was solid. Will return again.\n\n",

        "Alexander Freickmann\n91 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nMassage itself was ok, but i booked 90 minutes and the massage lady totally lost track on time, so she just stopped in the middle of the massage. Would be okish for me, but after she left, i saw, that it was nearly exact 90min after the start. Considering she also went to the toilet during the session for 5min and that i never experienced such a hard stop in a better spa, felt disappointing. Take it also as a note tvat all ladies inside are from PRC and quite young.\nAll in all wouldn't recommend for a massage\n\n",
