        "Kelvin Lee Thomas\nLocal Guide\u00b731 reviews\u00b721 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\n$80 for 1.5 hours massage. Highly recommend Sandy for people who like pressure. She incorporates a bit of Thai style massage into her moves which leaves me extremely refreshed\n\n",
        "Ed Chua\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\u00b720 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery good massage. A little bruised the day after though. My own fault that I tried to \u201ctake the pain\u201d.   They did ask if it was too hard. I\u2019ll definitely be back\n\n",
        "Lee Jeffrey\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGot a 1.5hour oriental massage done by a massue name Fei Fei. She is skillful and systematic. Can try if you need someone with strength and skill. Imagine i am 90 plus kilograms and i can feel the pressure when she press on my stiff back.\n\n",

        "sati ravi shenkaran\n1 review\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nthe masseuse really put in a lot of effort. went with my wife and the massage was really good, only that the front desk receptionist did not even care to pass/or tell us about the tea that was kept by the masseuse, maybe she was overwhelmed with tasks. Even then the receptionist when we went in did not seem to be cordial. so one star removed for that otherwise the masseuses' put in a lot of effort an its really worth the money\n\n",
        "Liyana Soh\nLocal Guide\u00b763 reviews\u00b761 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy husband and I visited this place for a one hour body massage, and it was heavenly. The session was painful but so effective that we had such a good deep sleep upon returning home. Even though the session was painful, I woke up the next day with no aches, which I usually experience if the masseuse doesn't know what they're doing.\n\n",
        "Polina\nLocal Guide\u00b7179 reviews\u00b7536 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy 1st visit to this salon and I loved it. Easy to make an appointment, staff speak English, clean, good price and quality. Ladies deal on Tuesdays is definitely worth it!\n\n",
        "V O\nLocal Guide\u00b747 reviews\u00b7125 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nFirst time, massage was very light but cos its near our place, we decided to buy the package anyway.\nSecond time here, we requested for stronger masseuse and the massage is good this time.\nBut both times we find it unacceptable that the staff outside the room all speak very loudly, I am here to have a nap and rest but I was woken up several times because of their chatter. First time it was a local staff kept chattering in hokkein/teochew, this time is all the Chinese staff shouting back & forth like a market.\nThis is a massage place packaged to be spa like, customers are coming here to rest and relax not listen to all these market chatter about urine. If this doesnt improve we will not continue the package again.\n\n",
        "CX\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nClean and comfortable environment.\nGood session with Mindy and highly recommend. She's able to detect and apply strength on my pain spots / knots on my shoulders and back.\nThere's yummy dessert after the session too.\nP.s. session was done in Dec-2019.\n\n",
        "Emily Lie\n3 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nThe massage was great, but I cannot believe my eyes when the massues did not flush their toilet after use, and it's not just once but twice and in a few cubicles! I even saw 1 massue ran out of the toilet after use, without flushing the toilet and do not even wash hands! What if she's rushing to attend to a customer with dirty hands? This is totally disgusting, unhygienic and shocking! Especially in this times when Covid-19 is still spreading! I'm not sure if I wanna go back ever again even the poor hygiene level. (Ps. I gave 2 stars because the massue massage skill is good).\n\n",
        "ShaunL\nLocal Guide\u00b736 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nThis place looks even better after its renovations. The service here is good and lots of care is provided by the masseurs. The rooms have private showering facilities for customers and the environment is relaxing. In my opinion, the masseurs' skills are good and I would visit again.\n\n",

        "John Mahathir\n6 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWorst service i have paid for an $80 massage. Came here as a regular but to only realise masseurs always cut time 10 minutes before end of session. Measured time only from my last three visits to realise their clock in the massage room is 10 minutes faster. Felt so deprived wasting my $80 here. They think customers are rich and print money to come here. Please do not do not do not visit the balestier outlet.\n\nAfter the owner responded to me in this threat, they informed me to call their hotline because they wanted to investigate. After calling on 30th August, counter person informed me to call another number instead. Then why put your hotline number in the first place? Why not just give me the direct manager\u2019s number? They also did not call me back. As spoken, I have went on 3 occasions before putting this one star review so please don\u2019t bother \u201cinvestigating\u201d.\n\n",

        "Alvin Ong\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nEven 1 star is too high for them. Bad experience, first & last time. TOLD doing massge for 2 or 3 of us, while waiting for another friend to reply, they gave away the two vacancies to walk in. Should have at least check with me again(I am just 5 m away from counter.\nWhen asked for someone, one of the staff look at me and just turn away......26/11/18 1 PM.\n\n",
