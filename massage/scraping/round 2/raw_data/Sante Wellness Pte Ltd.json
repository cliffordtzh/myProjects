Service was superb and massage was excellent. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nHusband had 90 Minutes Foot Massage by Hua Ge and he loved every minute of it. Helped him to relax.\n\nI had 60 Minutes Foot Massage and 30 Minutes Back Massage from Andy. Really awesome and he helped me to release the tension I had on my back (which has been really bad for a week now).\n\nBoth Hua Ge and Andy are gems and definitely recommended   \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\nDo give Sante Wellness a try if you are in the area! \ud83e\udd29\n\n",
        "Calvin Goh\n39 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nBeen a long time patron of this outlet but today was totally disappointed with the service staff i believe her name is yuki. Sent a what app msg as per usual practice to book a session but was queried on detail duration of the massage of which i had provided as per usual standard booking request. Very annoyed thereafter no reply for more than a hour n when i again asked she said done?? i ask her why she did not reply n confirm she just said not her but her colleague?? i told her this is not the service std as in the past whether the therapist we ask for is or not available we always get a quick reply as we can then plan or reschedule our time. She just said thank u for yr feedback n conversation with her abruptly ended by her!!! i am amazed by her action!!!\n\n",

        "Jervis Ching\n4 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nI asked them whether they are TCM registered so that I can claim the charges and they have confirmed twice that they are. But eventually they are not Singapore TCM registered and I whatsapp them with the screenshot and they never responded to me. Despite their poor knowledge and understanding of their business nature, the masseur is skillful though.\nWon't recommend if you need to claim the charges from insurance.\n\n",
