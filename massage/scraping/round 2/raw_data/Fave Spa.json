        "Joshua Thia\nLocal Guide\u00b7167 reviews\u00b7688 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTook a grab here in a rush as I was afraid that I would be late. Arrived early but had to wait for my appointment timing. Was greeted by the front-desk manager. Place is cosy, clean and very private. Small little cosy front shop that opens up to many rooms inside. My therapist Chloe was very friendly,  very polite and had very soothing hands. All in all a very relaxing massage.\n\n",

        "Ash Mohd\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHi. Firstly, The place really lives up to its name. I would like compliment one of the therapist. I had a Hot Oil Massage session with Isha on New Year's Day at 8pm. All i can say is she is great at what she is doing. She can sense that my body was super tense and she just knew how much pressure to apply and what technique to use. She even managed to resolve the problem i had with my right shoulder. I would definitely come back for more sessions at Fave Spa.\n\n",
