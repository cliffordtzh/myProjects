I had 90 minutes massage with Mss Linda yesterday. I got to know her through a friend of mine. First time experiencing massage from a Vietnamese girl. She is very beautiful. Working attitude is professional, hard working not the piano type and friendly .Sure will come back and find her again. Worth my money and time

Environment ok. But when we go to spa we want to feel relax. Enjoy the tenderly massage techniques. Especially when you book the right massue. You will feel at ease. The tiredness gone. Ache and discomfort suddenly gone. I have visited the place several times. But today, I finally managed to book the right massue. Her name is Aira. Looks n figure not important. She is a simple gal having good hands/fingers.The way she massage. The pressure point techniques. I really really enjoy the massage done by her... She really knows how to apply the firmness during massages. She is friendly too. I gave her 5 star. Fully recommended. Great job Aira. I will visit the place again and book her again and again n again as long she is working there.

the so called Japanese bubble massage is close to scam. they only put bubbles on you at the end of the massage. rub for less than 5 mins. that's all. and charge you $98 for such a normal massage. definitely will not  come back. tip 50 or 80 options. if you know what i mean

If only there were no construction going it would be peaceful massage. How ever Chanel did very well which I would recommend and of course return again to cater her massage.

Went on Sunday and had a very poor experience.
The masseuse was indifferent to how I felt even though I feedbacked many times it was very painful. She gave many unprofessional comments about how it is normal to be painful because of my body.

I developed body aches and even a fever of 38.4 degrees after the massage.

Avoid this place. Worst massage experience ever for me.

Went for a Japanese massage 1hour 30min $142 very relaxing and comfortable almost felt asleep.
Just when I about to felt asleep, the therapist asked if I want to add another $80 for extra service.
So is it very relaxing but also very expensive spa, hopefully next time can have some promotions on the extra service.
