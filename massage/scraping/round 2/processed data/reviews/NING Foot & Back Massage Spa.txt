First time leaving review. first time visiting this spa. Spontaneous visit. Firm but relaxing 60 mins back and shoulder massage. Paid $72. They sanitised after each customer.
I had a tight neck muscle on my left. Left the place with more relax shoulders. Only me and other customer on Thur late afternoon. They have lowered the price. Remember to refer to the printed copy pasted in front of counter as good. Copy on Google review is outdated.
Will visit again.

Discovered this gem at Jewel today. My masseuse, Irene, was super nice, friendly, working hard on all my knots, especially where I told her that I was feeling sore. The ambience was really relaxing and I could just sink into the very comfortable chair. Irene told me their business is very badly affected by the pandemic though. Do support them!

Lousy back and foot massage, feels like a back rub than massage. Therapists does not ask if the massage strength is ok or not. Don't feel any relief after the massage, will not visit again.

Had the 70min Foot and Back massage before my Long flight. Karen was my therapist and she did a amazing job of working out the knots. Flying, especially in economy Long haul puts a lot of pressure in the lumbar area so it was good to get some relief before another Long haul flight. Ambience and setting is nice.

Good atmosphere and quiet. Very relaxed and rejuvenated after the 40 mins massage.

Had an overpriced foot massage for 1 hour. The massage was average and they let you clean your feet by yourself at the begining of the session.
I gave my card and realised that they have charged me $85 (or $10 more than advertised). I asked for rectification and got just $5 back.
They advertise $75 but have a hand written tiny note that say (exl of 7% gst).
Overall, i felt ripped off by this massage place.

The massage was great by the therapist Irene. The amount of pressure was just on-point and relaxing!

We opted for the 100 minute massage today - the service is good. My therapist got rid of the tight knot at my back which I really appreciate. I'd recommend dropping by the place when you're in Jewel.

Went for a foot spa and it an extremely poor experience. It was already strange at the start that we had to dry our own feet after the foot bath and the spa scrub was outright painful. Therapist did not pay attention to blisters or cuts on the feet and pulled the skin off a fresh blister. Would not return

Should have paid more attention to the reviews. Lots of 5 star reviews by people who only have one review on their profiles... 

There's only a single masseuse who doesn't seem to know what she's doing. Lots of pressing with thumbs on the same spots. I left feeling more sore than refreshed. Didn't seem to know how to adjust the chair properly either, which left me seated in an uncomfortable position.

Great foot reflexology done by Mary. The pressure is fantastic and the strokes of the massage was good. Recommended place to go for the quick fix for the tired feet!

Looking for a massage place with hubby and chances upon NING FOOT & BACK SPA. Chosen a 40 min back and shoulder massage, therapists are KATHERINE and KAREN. They are very professional, it was so comfortable and techniques used were great. Place is clean and music is soothing.

Decided to get the 60min shoulder and back massage despite it being a bit pricey. The chair wasn't adjusted properly and incredibly uncomfortable. The 'massage' was a back rub at best and gave me zero relief from the knots in my neck and shoulders.
Couldn't wait for it to be over. Easily the worst massage I've ever had.

Great massage skills! Went in to get my very sore back and shoulders sorted and the therapist did not disappoint at all! She found every knot and sore point and after 40 minutes, my back felt so much 'lighter' and the soreness has completed disappeared. Highly recommend this spa joint

Irene, Jason, and Katherine were truly wonderful. After months of living in a developing country under stressful circumstances, it was lovely to be brought back with a massage here. Irene was able to relieve a lot of stress and I feel great.
