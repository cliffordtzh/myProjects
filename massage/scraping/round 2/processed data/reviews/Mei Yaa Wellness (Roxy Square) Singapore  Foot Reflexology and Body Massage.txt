Always a pleasure! They are using masks and gloves during the whole process. At the beginning feels a bit weird but after 5 min... U feel in heaven!  Thanks, Peter for his experience massage.

Done a 60mins foot massage by a lady masseur and I went back again the following day for 60mins full body massage with the same masseur. She was friendly and professional. No hard sell at all. Highly recommended.

I'm quite a big guy so it's hard to find a place that gives me good massage. The messeus here is so good I followed him when he was still at the Bedok South location. He uses strength at just the right parts, and really helps me relax after a long week. I can't recommend this place enough.

One of the best! Masseaus are very experienced and know just the right amount of strength to use along and acupuncture point to press

Good and cosy place to have massage regardless body or foot massage. Been here for many times, all the masseurs are really friendly and experienced. Definitely worth the price...must try at least once  Thanks the masseur Mr Patrick, excellent job.

Comfortable and relaxing massage in the east side! The therapist here are all very experienced with more than 10 years of experience. Enjoyed my full body massage here. Good place for massage!

Would recommend if you are nearby! It is hidden in the building of roxy square 2.

Tried Mei Yaa for the first time as I was looking for a massage shop nearby. Found this little gem through google. Clean ambience and good massage skills by Andy. Will definitely visit again!

(Translated by Google) The location is a bit secretive, but the masseur is great! Push this one! However, friends who are not able to do so should remember to remind the masseur about the intensity, haha. Arguably one of the best massage services I have tried in Singapore. "Service" value for money
