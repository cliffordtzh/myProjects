Went for my first full body massage here, for my hip pain. The masseuse was super professional, and focused on my hip tgt with the rest of my body. I have decided to frequent this wonderful place every 3 months from now. Thank you!

Me and my husband were served by Hua Ge and Andy. Service was superb and massage was excellent. 

Husband had 90 Minutes Foot Massage by Hua Ge and he loved every minute of it. Helped him to relax.

I had 60 Minutes Foot Massage and 30 Minutes Back Massage from Andy. Really awesome and he helped me to release the tension I had on my back (which has been really bad for a week now).

Both Hua Ge and Andy are gems and definitely recommended   

Do give Sante Wellness a try if you are in the area!

Been a long time patron of this outlet but today was totally disappointed with the service staff i believe her name is yuki. Sent a what app msg as per usual practice to book a session but was queried on detail duration of the massage of which i had provided as per usual standard booking request. Very annoyed thereafter no reply for more than a hour n when i again asked she said done?? i ask her why she did not reply n confirm she just said not her but her colleague?? i told her this is not the service std as in the past whether the therapist we ask for is or not available we always get a quick reply as we can then plan or reschedule our time. She just said thank u for yr feedback n conversation with her abruptly ended by her!!! i am amazed by her action!!!

Therapist Shan Shan was very good and helped me with the pain I was experiencing. Front desk Yuki also helped to explain what kind of massages I needed to ensure I get better. 10/10 would recommend to anyone!

Had a really good massage today done by -ge! He was very detail-oriented when it comes to the massage and shared with me on the different points that he was massaging and how each of them mattered.

Definitely would visit again and am already looking forward to my next visit.

Our favourite massage place to revisit. Alice, Andy and Wah were highly skilled in their profession, with many years of experience. They are able to pinpoint our problem areas and provided practical advice. Very cosy and comfortable ambience as well.

Went there a few times whenever I'm in the area. Really liked the ambience and service quality. Pricing is competitive and the massage is not too bad as well. Would really recommend.

I've been going to Sante Wellness TCM Clinic for the past 3months to receive various TCM service like Tuina,Moxibustion, Acupuncture, Cupping,and Scrapping. Each service and therapy was done with care to focus on improving my healthy as I struggle with some issue of my lower back.I can't say enough good things about the trained therapist and Physicians.
I especially want to mention Dr Ng for Acupuncture, Therapist Andy,Ting,Shan and Eva for very strong Tuina(Massage).and Wah and Alice for targeted Tuina to address body/muscle imbalance s.
To round it all out the management/reception team(Manager Yuki, Cecelia)is kind, passionate,and proactive.
Not to mention fun and appropriately silly.
If you're looking for total care....look no further.
Get an appointment.
Highly recommended Sante Wellness TCM,

Was recommended by my friend. Professional service. Was having a tensed shoulder due to bad seating posture due to work from home. Came for ginger massage and detox treatment. Feel totally relaxed after just an hour of massage.

I asked them whether they are TCM registered so that I can claim the charges and they have confirmed twice that they are. But eventually they are not Singapore TCM registered and I whatsapp them with the screenshot and they never responded to me. Despite their poor knowledge and understanding of their business nature, the masseur is skillful though.
Won't recommend if you need to claim the charges from insurance.

Effective massage to resolve aches and fatigue, reasonable price, good location with ample parking. Clean and tidy place is a bonus.
