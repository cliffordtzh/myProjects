Therapist didnt seem to really know what he was doing. Asked for a strong massage, didnt really get as much strength as was needed. Went because my regular massage place was booked out and I was walking in pain with a very obvious knot in my foot arch - am a dancer so I need to be able to move about pain free. The therapist not only did not seem to feel the knot, he barely touched it, did not release it at all. It was all very cursory, I may as well not have gone for the foot reflex in the first place. Could have done a better job at home releasing it myself. Will not be going back. Waste of time and money.

Clean and no frills massage place. Did the half an hour back massage and Uncle Heng really knows exactly how to work the knots out without me telling him where. Will definitely go back again!

Amazed by professional massage. The old lady customized her massage by finding right spot and strong pressure. I was totally healed by her great skill. She is also very kind and understanding. So i visited twice during my short biz trip.

I went to this place before jumping on a 13hr flight and Im so glad I did! Ive had tight back muscles all my life and never had it properly loosened from a massage (all the others were just painful but werent very effective). Great technique, I wish I could find similar elsewhere. Highly recommend and Ill be back every time I stop over in SG!

Great technique with just-nice strength by a young guy. Amazing.

Would recommend to book an appointment if you wanna go on the weekends (they are popular!)

I called to try and book a massage, but when I asked if they used synthetic fragrance, they hung up on me. No answer/busy signal when calling back.

I love the fuss-free foot reflexology here. Prices are affordable and there are many options for time-stretched folks like me.
