        "Alesia Chee\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBooked a surprise massage for my hubby to relax his tired body. Was in the room throughout the massage and I must say the therapist is very good even my hubby mention her skill is good. Highly recommend outcall spa.\n\n",
        "Des Puey\n2 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis was my first experience with call in home services and it won\u2019t be the last. Ange was helpful in assisting the booking when I ran into technical difficulties quickly and promptly. Appreciate that the therapists are female as I personally feel safer and more comfortable with a service provider of the same gender. My therapist was Yuki and she was not only professional but also attentive to my tight muscles. Highly recommend The Outcall Spa if anyone is still on the fence.\n\n",
        "Elton Li\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe lady arrived as to the agreed timing and with a friendly smile. Setting up was pretty speedy and within 10 mins I\u2019m on the portable bed ready for the massage session. Overall experience was good and I\u2019m glad I found the right one although the pricing seems rather on the high side. Hoping for more promotional update!\n\n",

All thanks to Ange from Outcall Spa for her professionalism in handling the arrangement. The masseur was good, nice setup with soothing music. Mobile bed is sturdy. Never expect such spa can be actualised at home. This is an underrated service at most affordable price. Well run company. Keep it up!\n\n",
        "Lin Changjie\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWith the recent heightened alerts, le wife was resourceful and creative and engaged the Outcall Spa for me to have a massage at the comfort of our homes! Lovely surprise indeed - the masseuses were good and professional, mobile bed setup was sturdy and stable, it just felt like the having a massage at the shop! Thanks for the wonderful experience!\n\n",
        "Rasyida Sam\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had a therapist over at my house on June 10. The therapist arrived early, giving her time to set up the massage bed and towels, and had to fuss the whole time while I got ready for my massage. By the time I was ready, she had the spa music on, helping me relax. The massage was also relaxing, and she constantly checked if the pressure was okay especially when working on the knots on my stiff neck. I felt relaxed after the session. Overall, I recommend Outcall Spa, especially for busy working parents who have no time to visit a spa offsite.\n\n",
        "Qi Min Ho\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy massage therapist was Vinita. Had a really great experience with her service. Pressure was just nice and she was very polite. The booking system was also very fuss free. Highly recommend!\n\n",
        "Siti Zaharah\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nEnjoyed a day off with my partner for a couple massage. Masseuse was experienced and was helping me understand why my body was hurting at some areas and recommended things for me to do if it still hurts. My partner enjoyed himself as well. Table is really comfortable as well. Will recommend everyone to try it despite the price. It\u2019s worth it!\n\n",
        "Zhenni Lee\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst booking with them. Female masseur came to my house on time. She set-up the bed, massage oil selection and turn on spa music. Love her pressure point on my neck and back. I really enjoyed 90mins of massage! Thank you JJ!\n\n",
        "Chantel Ong\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOutcall Spa is so awesome as you get to enjoy the massage within your own home. Outcall spa would first try to understand your preference, whether u prefer stronger or lighter massages before assigning you the right masseuse. I did a prenatal massage for 90mins with my masseuse, Olive. Was told that she is stronger which i sincerely appreciate! It was a wonderful 90mins as she educated me on why certain areas are aching more and why I am swelling, also taught me tips to prevent the recurrence. I love the experience so much I am actually considering signing up for the package and requesting for Olive. Hahahaha! Give it a try!\n\n",

        "shikin kikin\n8 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTwo thumbs up! If I had more thumbs, I would gladly give it to The Outcall Spa! Service was beyond expectations. Staffs were very professional, engaging and friendly. They were also very knowledgeable and shared about the ailments and pressure points about our body. The portable massage table was also super sturdy to my surprise! I liked that they brought along their own music to give us a more relaxing and sensual experience. We will definitely recommend this to friends and family and even to you reading this review! Pick up the phone and book them to have a feel of what I am talking about. U won't regret! :D\n\n",

Especially for busy mothers like me who cannot afford much time to travel out of the house, what better way to pamper youself with a massage in the comforts of your own home at your convenience. Standard is nothing short of a professional spa massage with aromatherapy oils, relaxing music and hot tea served after. Thanks Amber for the wonderful gift! :)\n\n",
        "Qiu Xin\nLocal Guide\u00b75 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOne of the most pleasent experience I ever had. They were really punctual, in fact they arrived earlier than schedule. I did the 4D eyelash extension which turns out to be really natural and the whole entire process was so comfortable that I fell asleep.  There is 100% not irritation to or discomfort. Will highly recommend them.\n\n",
        "Adrian Lee\n4 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHave a very great experience with their services.\nFirstly they will try to cater with my timing. Made a advance appointment for Valentine's Day celebration.\nThey will come 10mins earlier to set the beds and equipment so as not to eat into my massage duration. Very punctual.\nTheir massages are very good, first time in my life I fell asleep like a baby during a massage.\nVery good experience to have a massage in the comfort of my home.\nHighly recommended to couples or individuals that wants a massage but dun wanna waste time travelling. Will definitely go for their service again the next time.\n\n",

        "Angela Ng\nLocal Guide\u00b796 reviews\u00b762 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery professional set-up. My masseuse (Catherine) was conscientious, focused and kind. Loved that a proper massage table was provided (and efficiently assembled!) and that we ended with hot ginger tea. Definitely a splurge (prices aren't cheap) but worth it if you want to pamper yourself with a spa experience in the convenience of home.\n\nI didn't get music or candles like in the video though. Not a big deal. :)\n\n",

        "Isabella Lim\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt was a very pleasant first experience with the Outcall Spa. I was surprised that I was able to get a same-day appointment for a prenatal massage at the comfort of my own home easily. I must praise the good service/communication provided via WhatsApp that allowed me to clarify my queries and get the booking done so promptly. My therapist was Nurul, and she is very experienced and was careful in her massage strokes as I\u2019m in the later term of my pregnancy. She also kept checking in with me if everything is fine and if the pressure is right. The whole home service included a massage bed, music, essential oil, lights, and ended with a nice warm ginger tea! Perhaps the only thing if I have to mention anything negative is that the price is on the higher side, but I guess the service and quality of the massage explains why.\n\n",
