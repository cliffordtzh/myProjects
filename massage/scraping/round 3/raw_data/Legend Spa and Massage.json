        "lavanya kalyanakrishnan\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI just finished my 90-min foot massage at Legend.  My feet were swollen due to water retention due to pregnancy.  The masseuse (I didnt manage to get her name \ud83d\ude14) was amazing.  She checked on pressure and my comfort.  During the entire 90 mins she didnt slack nor did her pressure  She was very considerate and very professional.  During the session, i had a dry cough incident and was immediately attended to with warm water.  After the massage, the masseuse ensured that my feet were wiped off of any excess cream / oil for my safety and even escorted me all the way out.\n\nThe masseuse gave me the BEST foot massage ever!  Thanks Legend for a Legendary experience.\n\nYou now have a loyal customer!\n\n",
        "Clara Lie\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nGreat masseur, was very nice and understanding but front desk / receptionist was terrible at service. Did not double check what I wanted and wasted my time but booking the wrong session. Insincere apology was given at the end as well.\n\n",
        "Diana Narbutait\u0117\nLocal Guide\u00b713 reviews\u00b721 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVisited 4 times already and like the attitude, customer service and feel much better after the masage\n\n",
        "Japna Logan\n20 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nGood if you know which masseuse to ask for, value for money. Slight hesitation to go now as I noticed last time they do not check customers temperature, also makes me wonder what else they are compromising on. Saw the masseuses enter one morning and no one took their temperature either!\n\n",
        "Te Shan Liang\n131 reviews\u00b71,587 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nClean, well run. Comfortable relaxing ambience. Good therapists. Decent prices.\n\n",
        "\u00c1kos Rig\u00f3\n9 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGenerally my experience was good throughout my multiple visits (roughly 10 times), although the last 2 times I had a terrible masseuse. She had rushed hand movements and pressed on my spine and bones a few times. Complained after 30 minutes of the 1 hour massage and they replaced the masseuse, but there was no other compensation for the negative experience other than promising some complimentary scent oil worth SGD 10 the next time I visit. The second masseuse was good. I was advised I should have complained after 15 minutes - however I was never informed about this rule before.\n\nCurious how this will play out the next time I visit. Lost a fair bit of trust but will still give them a chance.\n\n",
        "Kedar Tembe\nLocal Guide\u00b7217 reviews\u00b730 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nReally good experience. Did an hour of reflexology, and for me, the measure of how good a massage is, is reflected in whether I sleep or not :). Needless to say, I woke myself with my snoring in the midst of the massage. So the therapist definitely hit the right spots.\n\n",
        "Guillaume RAYNAL\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nClean place, no need to pay the oil, the massage was strong (I asked for it), good communication with the masseur!\n\n",
        "K Yeo\nLocal Guide\u00b7170 reviews\u00b71,030 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nMassage was good but a spa experience is more than that. Bathroom in room was faulty. Wall mouldy, air con noisy and furnishing was worn out. I should have asked for another room but the fact that I was offered that particular room reflected the service quality.\n\n",
        "Prashanth Kumar\nLocal Guide\u00b78 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery clean place around siglap area 55$ for 1 hr massage at the time of positing. The massueses are the best I have ever seen.\n\nI love this place as this is one of the place that don't pester you to take the packages after your massage. I have been here several times and have recommend several friends relatives to try this place and everyone loved it.\n\nWatch out for their occasional promotion at off peak times that offer free extra half hour massage for the price of 1 hr.\n\n",
        "Dinesh S\n34 reviews\u00b713 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nIt's a dogdy massage place. Staff don't understand or speak proper English. Not acceptable for the service industry. And I'm not sure about my credit card transaction because i saw i was charged $80 on the machine but the receipt printed out $55 for an hour massage. Asked for a refund and left.\n\n",
        "Boonchun Yeo\nLocal Guide\u00b755 reviews\u00b7341 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nPass by this place several times and finally we made an appointment for full body massage. My back was hurting for several days and now showing sign of improvement after this session. Place is clean and staffs are friendly.\n\n",
        "itsrui\nLocal Guide\u00b782 reviews\u00b7588 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat massage everytime. Been there a few times and the massage standard is consistent despite us not having a fixed masseuse to go to. Open till wee hours. Thumbs up if you are staying in the East!\n\n",
        "sanilkku\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nPathetic massage will never recommend anyone to go there. I for sure will not go. Not at all relaxing massage.\n\n",
        "Weishan Seah\n4 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nOne of the best massage that I had. The therapist knows the exact spot that my back is aching and is able to massage it away. 90 minutes massage seems so fast. Will return again.\n\n",
        "Mom Koh\n3 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nNew and clean however service and skill level of other similarly priced places in the neighborhood are better. I will suggest bringing your own oil to the massage as they otherwise charge additional $10 per person\n\n",
        "Nasty Gal\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVivi is really good! Will book with her again. She's friendly and had good pressure and technique :) See you again!\n\n",

        "Loong Lee\nLocal Guide\u00b7180 reviews\u00b7122 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVery good Chinese style Tui Na, they will massage and rub your back rigorously with oil, similar to Gua Sha that releases unhealthy elements from your body and stimulates blood flow\n\n",
