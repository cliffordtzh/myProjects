        "norani othman (nor othman)\n8 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have used their services for the past few years and the store has recently undergone a renovation. There is only space for 3 reflexology clients and 2 massage beds which meant you have to make a booking prior to your visits. I like it because there is space to move around and you are not cramped together. The masseurs are skilled and friendly and know how to untie knots in your body and feet. They have a membership package but they don't push it aggressively. Highly recommended.\n\n",

From senior team leader Gary, to senior staff David, Iqa, Ah Meng, and Uncle Ken. Ex staff, Sam. We know them all too well.\n\nTheir skills all differs yes, definitely. Some are new some are seniors. No doubt, all their skills and knowledge are good in terms of pressure points, pressure applied, understanding of muscles aches, advices on health, are acceptably good.\n\nSome people may not like it, but its personal preference really. We love it, not only because of their painful massage which works but their warm welcome hospitality and service towards all their customers.\n\nPic 1 : Gary working on my feet\nPic 2 : David on my hubby\n\n",

        "Kou Cai Tan\nLocal Guide\u00b721 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nSaw 90 over 5 star reviews and was eager to try. Sadly the experience paled in comparison. Opted for an hour body as my body was aching from sports.\n\nStrength was good but didn't quite hit the right spots. Pressure applied was inconsistent towards the 2nd half of the massage. She barely used any strength when massaging the left it band area. Right calf, hip and it band was skipped for some unknown reason.\n\nWill return for a massage by the widely praised Mr Gary next time. Hope to get a better experience and will update this review\n\n",

Our masseuses were Ah Zhen and Ikah, who were both excellent and targeted all the right points. We have been to many massage shops in Singapore and were blown away by the level of expertise, and immediately signed up as members ($68 for one year and includes a free 40min body + 40min foot massage). We really appreciate how honest this business is ran, as they do not sell packages and the membership scheme is perfect for regulars who can get some savings without spending a bomb to  buy a package. Prices are very reasonable too!\n\n",

Ended up paying 48 instead cos they said 30/30 is another combo which I wasn't even informed B4 hand so it juz doesn't seem honest to me thou he said sorry he forgot to tel me \ud83d\ude44...
