They gave me a masseuse who could not understand English.\n\nI kept telling her I was in pain however she could not understand. It was a painful massage and I now have severe aches that I have not slept well for two days.\nTried contacting Green Apple Spa about my experience and want to advise them to only use English speaking masseuse for non-Chinese customers, however no response.\n\n",
        "J N\n12 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI\u2019ve been to GAS many times before, and it is still my go-to place for massage. Called to reserve a 1.5h slot for leg & shoulder massage, and requested for a private room for couple. Upon arrival, I was welcomed warmly and was shown to the private room \ud83d\ude01\n\nMy masseur was Coco and she would adjust her strength according to my request.\n\n10/10 for service & massage. Would definitely visit GAS again.\n\n",
        "Connie Tan\nLocal Guide\u00b757 reviews\u00b7263 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time to this branch, usually visit their Tanjong Pagar branch. Very nice, cozy environment. . Seats were comfortable and they had a big screen playing movies. Staff were all friendly, from reception to masseur. Very skillful and enough pressure, and will check few times with you to make sure pressure was ok. Recommended to visit here.\n\n",

        "Jonathan Parry\nLocal Guide\u00b794 reviews\u00b7146 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAlways come here. The place is really good. I come alone so they can usually find me a spot which is great. Can get a little noisy though if you get some other loud patrons which is a bit annoying. I\u2019d recommend all the green apple outlets.\n\n",

Friendly, professional staff who take care of you whilst delivering very good, relaxing massages every time.\n\nBooking has been easy for me, with long advance reservations not usually required.\n\nI have recommended to friends and contacts.\n\n",
        "Aqylla J\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy masseur Francis knew all the correct pressure points and the perfect amount of pressure to apply. But would constantly ensure that I was comfortable which made me feel very at ease. Not one to go for massages in Singapore but this is my second time here and it\u2019s worth all the money spent. Will definitely come back and look for Francis again. My mom and sister also really enjoyed the experience can\u2019t wait to be back.\n\n",
        "Nurul Mimsy\nLocal Guide\u00b772 reviews\u00b7300 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nHad one of the best massages here. Went for the 30 minutes foot + 60 minutes body massage combo. Receptionist was friendly. We came on Saturday night and got lucky, as we could walk in without an appointment. But it is advisable to make a booking beforehand.\n\nRated one star down because the foot massage was quite meh. The male masseuse didn\u2019t put much pressure and the area we were at (Level 1) was next to their staff resting area, and there was a young male masseuse watching videos without using an earpiece. Kind of disrupting my peace and quiet.\n\nBut my body massage was freaking amazing, seriously. I didn\u2019t manage to get my masseuse\u2019s name but ironically, she was much stronger than the male masseuse I had earlier, and paid attention to details to get rid of my knots and muscle soreness.\n\nWill definitely come back.\n\n",
        "Xavier Wang\nLocal Guide\u00b742 reviews\u00b764 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nThe receptionist has a pretty poor attitude, she simply can't be bothered whether at the counter or over the phone. This puts a real damper on the overall experience. The massage quality really depends on who is the masseuse, and there's been some hits and misses.\n\n",

        "Elly Suhaila\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI am satisfied with the massage and experience. Can say this is one of the best massage i had in SG! Did combo 1hr body + 30mins foot and was attended by 2 different masseuse for each. Both was equally good and massage were super on point.\nThe only downside was the receptionist who did not share the promotion and we actually paid a higher price when we could have enjoyed the discount. Nevertheless the massage makes up for it!\nWill come back but will be smarter on the ongoing promo!!\n\n",
        "Ho Zan Wen\n9 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGreat massage... Chatted with masseur all the way and dont feel pressured to like having to sign a package... Just tot it would have been better if got some relaxing music at the background... Price quite reasonable too for a full massage at 90 mins...\n\n",
        "Andy Yap\nLocal Guide\u00b713 reviews\u00b741 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nThe leg massage exceed my expectations.. The strength on the massage is quite good... Rem to see there is promo the customer service crew at the counter did told us so we took the more worthy package for slight longer massage time\n\n",

        "Roderick X\n6 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGreat place to unwind and enjoy a Chinese style Zhi Ya massage. Environment is clean and quiet. Opens till late but reservation is preferred. Price is reasonable too.\n\n",
        "Gerald\n16 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nFoot massage was not relaxing at all. Hurt way too much\n\n",
        "Andrew Chwee\nLocal Guide\u00b7712 reviews\u00b72,874 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI liked this place. Generally, the masseur here is very well trained although there are some are not. Price is reasonable for Singapore and it's packed most time so do your booking (just call and reserve) early to avoid disappointment. Opens till late night so you almost can get your tired legs cared for while watching a movie on their large screen. If you are looking for a private zone out place, this is not it.\n\n",
        "Dirle Wanger\n6 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nMassage was ok. But don\u2019t expect to be able to zone out. The amount of noise, talk, laughing, burping, walking in and out of shop just ruined it being a relaxing experience. Tell your staff to be quiet and respect the customer paying money to relax.\n\n",

        "Jingshun Lim\nLocal Guide\u00b722 reviews\u00b748 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat place for ad-hoc massage, therapists have all been very skilled and professional. And, very importantly - there's no pressure to buy any packages. No up selling at all! That's a great peace of mind!\n\n",
        "Anwar Ali\n3 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\n1st time here, made a booking for full body for 3 people,myself and my parents.  we asked if its ok for 1 hour 30 mins for 3 of us , the front counter guy said ok and went to charge the card accordingly.  A few seconds later he said sorry can only do 1 hour, he then went to void the transaction and proceed to ask us to make another payment . After which we went to our rooms, to my horror I had to share the room with my dad. I am not ok with that .I went downstairs to the counter guy and asked him if there are any other single rooms , he said all fully booked. And proceed to blame me for not informing them when he himself didn't confirm with us before payment was made for the 1st and 2nd time. I don't think its a usual practice for us to ask for single rooms , I didn't want to make a wasted trip so I cancelled my full body and opt for foot massage instead for obvious price difference he had to refund cash since we initially paid for 3 full body.  Here comes the worst part, while enjoying my foot massage the counter guy come and interrupted my massage by giving me the refund.  Why can't you give it to me later after my massage? Honestly this would have been a great review if things were better.I'm really not happy with the counter guy working on 27th December 2020 on 9pm when we came\n\n",

        "Yvonne Goh\nLocal Guide\u00b726 reviews\u00b793 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nInconsistent protocol. Booked a 60 minutes body massage today with my friend. She got a good masseuse who communicated with her on the pressure and areas she wanted more work on.\n\nWhereas I got a masseuse who did not ask me a thing and exerted so much pressure throughout even after I told her to be gentler twice. She focused a lot on the top parts of my back that I'm feeling more aches than when I went in. My back feels bruised that I'm having trouble lying on it to sleep now.\n\nThere was a bit of head massage which just felt like her pushing her fingers into my scalp and trying to decrease the size of my head.\n\nFor $59, the massage was definitely not what I expected, with the masseuse I got. I hope they review their masseuse's skills and ensure all ask simple questions (room temp, pressure, areas to focus more on) to their clients before and during the massage.\n\n",
        "Gerald Tan\nLocal Guide\u00b739 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nBeen a Long time customer of Green Apple Spa. The massage techniques are not bad and is highly dependent on which masseuse you are assigned. Chairs felt abit dated although were luxurious and the foot massage area has a large projector TV showing movies. Calming atmosphere but prices are high.\n\n",
        "Mohamed Hassan Noordin\nLocal Guide\u00b745 reviews\u00b7109 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFantastic place with awesome customer service. Place is good for spa. Big wide screen projector and comfortable seats\n\n",
        "B.\nLocal Guide\u00b7105 reviews\u00b71,101 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery good massage at this place. First floor is mainly for foot massage. Second floor is for body massage. For those who wants to have privacy, there are two VIP rooms available on the first floor. I did body massage on first floor VIP room foot massage chair. It was very comfortable. Will visit again.\n\n",

So if ur dying for a massage this is the place. Decent place. No \"special\" service.\n\n",
        "Amanda Fong\n2 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nBooked a one hour foot massage at this evening and was assigned to the masseuse, Yoyo. I initially already found it strange that a female masseuse is serving me as most of the foot masseuse are males. Her massage was really bad. It felt as if she was playing with my foot during the hour although I can see that she was trying. Seems like a technique/ training issue. Will likely not return and if I really were to do so, I will definitely request for a male masseuse.\n\n",
        "Michelle Cronin\nLocal Guide\u00b798 reviews\u00b74,785 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nIt's a great spa, I went for a 60 minute foot massage. The couches in the \"cinema room\" are v comfortable and it's nice to be able recline and watch a movie if you want. The only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 is because the toilet smells like a urinal and my feet were slipping in my shoes after, prefer the feet to be washed at the end.\n\n",
        "Celine Yen\nLocal Guide\u00b782 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nLady who does the massage has good skills. Staff at counter did not let me know about 90mins promo which otherwise i will have give 5 stars.\n\n",

        "Robert\nLocal Guide\u00b741 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nFirstly they weren\u2019t taking anyone\u2019s temperature which seems highly reckless. The atmosphere is terrible and no way relaxing. They had a movie playing at a loud volume and the room smelled of mould. The massage was ok but was unable to enjoy because of how horrible the environment was.\n\n",

        "Mann Dee Ng\n3 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nFirst time here, reccomended by a family member. Pleasant services and my sore and stiff back felt much better in the good hands of therapist Katie. The face hole on the bed is uncomfortable for prolong duration. Likely the same at most massage parlours.\n\n60mins body massage at $56 (without aromatherapy oil). Those interested in body massages will recommend to do at least 90mins.\n\n",
        "WenD Tan\nLocal Guide\u00b7460 reviews\u00b71,233 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThere was no systematic way of massaging the feet.. I have been to much better place like Kohong and kenko.\n\nThe most disturbing was that there was a huge area of black mold on the wall (on the screen where they project a random movie)  near the airconditioning vent in the first floor foot massage area.\n\n",
