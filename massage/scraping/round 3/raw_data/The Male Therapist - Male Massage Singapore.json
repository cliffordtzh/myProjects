        "Chung Tyan Soon\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDavid is a professional, skillful and a really friendly person. I feel very welcomed from the moment I enter the shop. Overall the massage given was really relaxing and it was wonderful. He never rush throughout the session and takes his time in targeting sore muscles. Also had the body scrub, by removing dead skin on your body and combined with a brilliant massage it definitely makes you leaving feeling fresh and clean! I would recommend David for anyone who is looking for a great massage therapist in Singapore.\n\n",
        "Anthony Ong\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nExcellent service from David. The massage was firm and strong. Especially liked the stretches. The body scrub after the session made me felt clean.\n\nVery nice chap as well. Attentive and knowledgeable about his traits. Highly recommended!\n\n",
        "Hsu Vincent\nLocal Guide\u00b741 reviews\u00b7156 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nReally bad experience. He just put the oil on your body and he doesn't use any energy to massage on you!\nEven worse, he just try waste the time and he prepared the tea for almost 10 mins! Can be calculated, I just get 45 mins massage, not 60 mins.\n\nAll the comments are really fake.\n\n",

        "lurkee123\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTherapist David is very professional, friendly and makes you feel at home with his conversation. I have had both the 'Totality' and Swedish massages - former is more relaxing and latter is stronger - and both are very good. The place is clean, neat, with a shower and easily accessible. I went 5 times in the last 3 weeks so would hIghly recommend him.\n\n",

        "handy Waluyo\nLocal Guide\u00b762 reviews\u00b7180 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI was there last 17th at 0920pm,  took body scrub treatment.  Its like... .  The receptionist n theraphist poor English. The quality of treatment terrible n  less then 50 minutes as mentioned at menu.  The spa product is a question mark.  Spent $80 Sg or more is not worthed to come here.  I was willing to meet with Manager,  but he wasbt in charge there.  I am working at hotel spa in Bali.  The price is cheaper then here,  but quality cant compare.\n\nNeed a lot of improve.\n\n",
