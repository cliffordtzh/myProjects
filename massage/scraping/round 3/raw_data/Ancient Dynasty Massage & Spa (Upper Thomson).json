        "Summer C\n5 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBeen here a few times, each time i was satisfied with their service. They are able to produce hand written receipts. For parking there were minimal parking spaces, for bikes there are only 2 lots around there. Staff were friendly. There were even off peak prices available for those who wish to avoid crowds. The masseuses are skilful and good. I don\u2019t know their names but I did not have to ask for specific masseuse to enjoy my massages. Pocket friendly as well. Would recommend this place!\n\n",
        "a\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have been here many times and attended by many masseuse. I must say firstly the price is pretty good as it is at the lower end of the market rate for a 1hr full body massage.\n\nSecondly, the masseuse i recommend is Nana. The spots she massages and the amount of strength is just right for me as this is a deep tissue massage and she always hits the right spots with the right strength\n\n",

The massage was average and didn\u2019t hit the right spots. Sadly, the room wasn\u2019t well kept and towel has a little musky smell.\n\n",
        "ked A\n5 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nPlace smells damp, musty and looks tired. Masseuse lacks experience but has strength. While waiting for my friend to finish, spotted a baby roach near the seating area. There are slightly cheaper and better quality massage places for less than $80 for 90 mins nearby Upper Thomson.\n\n",
        "Shanice Ng\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSuper love it!! Came a few times with my hubby, decided to bring my mum and auntie for a massage & hot stone therapy as they have been experiencing body ache for sometimes. I am glad that they enjoy the massage session here. By the way, i love their peppemint and lemongrass oil its so aromatic feel in the room. And the counter staff is very helpful and friendly too. One side note is their behind car park can be limited slot at times. Definitely will come back again soon!\n\n",

        "Lim Cheryl\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nVisited Ancient Dynasty Thomson branch on 3 April, Saturday. Read that this place has affordable and good massage so decided to give it a try. Was looking forward to the massage since my shoulders have been aching for days.\n\nBoy did I regret my decision. The moment my masseuse came in and put the towel over my back, I knew she was just doing it for the sake of it. Everything was done in a rush. I booked for an hour of whole body massage but left the place not feeling any better. Masseuse don't even know where are the areas to massage as she was pressing close to my spine. I thought this was by accident so I kept quiet. Then she did it again when she was pressing my lower back.\n\nNever returning to this place ever again.\n\n",
        "Nor Ayda\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nDisappointed! First & the last visit here.\n\nWent on a non-peak period, Tuesday midnight to be exact.. Family of 5pax. To be honest it was a last minute thing so had no choice as other places were fully booked.\nWe have been patronizing the other outlet at Siglap and it was really good, even after midnight but sadly it was full.\nSmooth booking and receptionist is friendly.\nFour of us had the usual Deep Tissue Massage for 90 mins and another 1 of us had the foot massage.\nOverall checked with the rest ~ Their massage was also as bad as mine. :(\nSo here's what happened during my 90 mins massage;\n1) Aircon was too cold.\n2) For the whole 1 hour plus was like a \"slow motion\" kind of massage as I guess she was taking her own sweet time to pass the time..\n3) 90% - Forearm and elbow , 10% - Pressure using hands/fingers (this 10% were only used during the last 15 to 20 mins time nearing to the end when I was lying facing up.)\n4) Forearm was used to press and slide across my body just like how you spread the kaya on your bread but this one is using Forearm and Oil instead.\n5) Elbow was pressed down at different parts of my body for at least 20-30 seconds each time. (Yes I counted as the clock on the wall is ticking just beside me.)\n7) She pressed in between my thumb and second finger so hard that it's painful as I was typing the review now.\n8) And ya, I was supposed to wipe off the excess oil all over my body as it was self service I supposed.\n\nJust to highlight, it's not my first time going for a massage and I would normally go for a massage at least once or twice in a month (at other places).\nI'm not a review kind of person but I really felt cheated and just wasted $375 for all 5 of us.\nCame with a tired and sore body but came back with a painful experience. :(\n\n",
        "bella chew\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI would like to compliment both my therapists for me and my husband (Mika & Jamie) i had at Ancient Dynasty. I have a super ached lower back and shoulder pain due to long seating of hours and using of laptop. I cant take the pain and insomnia for a few days already, so went to search for some good and value for money spa i have decided to call in and make an appointment with them. Its was a simple, cozy place and humble individual treatment room, what i like is its a door type not a curtain type. Which i felt its more privacy , next come to the massage its really really good at least for me i feel so much better. To be honest, its pain at times but my therapist explain to me why its pain due to muscle tension and i will feel the sore for the next few days for recovery purposes. Personally feel is that best to communicate with them which area or any issue you would like to address. End of the massage i felt lighter and better, and they have ginger tea and red date tea too. I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends as they open late too which is a super good choices for me. Thank you ancient dynasty team at thomson branch. Last note, they never hard selling any packages and very friendly staff. ;)\n\n",
        "Terence Tham\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\ni dont normally write reviews, But the receptionist Sheryl really deserve a good review. i came 30mins late due to traffic but she still manage to keep my appointment after following up with me! massage feels good too at good rates! definitely recommend!\n\n",
        "Boris\nLocal Guide\u00b712 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThe masseuse here not professional at all. Massage shoulder also like piano, no power at all, just plain lazy. After the whole session, still feel shoulders very sore and tight. After massage, warm Water just put on the table at the entrance of the shop. Go to Healing Touch instead, don\u2019t waste your time and money here.\n\n",
        "Daria L\n6 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nIf I could I would give it 0 stars for horrible booking service. My husband and I booked a massage at their Upper Thomson branch, went for our appointment on time (and with proof of booking) only to find out another couple was given our slot. Staff (Sheryl) refused to demand for proof of booking from the other couple as she didn\u2019t want to \u201cdisturb\u201d them while taking their massage. If they could not provide proof of booking, she could have rightly asked them to leave the premises as they had taken our slot but she didn\u2019t want to. Can\u2019t speak for the masseuses\u2019 skills as we weren\u2019t able to experience them.\n\n",
        "Valerie Tan\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBeen coming to this place since 2014/15, and had just finish my relaxing massage. So far all the therapists are quite skillful and the price is really good @$68 for 1.5 hrs. I've recommended a few friends here and they commented it's relaxing. One of them even tell me, it's one of the few places that he will fall asleep during massage. If you need stronger massage just let the therapist knows.\n\n",

        "Irene\n8 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nMasseuse isn't as professional as the ones in the past. Not greeted at the entrance after massage session is completed and plainly leave the drink at the table. Paid $80 for 1.5 hours massage on a weekend during off peak period.\n\n",
        "amms r\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThis used to be my favorite place for massage. I have come here several times over two years. I had introduced this place to other people as well. But in recent times, the standard for massage has really dropped. I did notice that alot of the masseurs that I used to see working here, aren't anymore. Not sure if it's due to Covid. Gave this place one more chance today despite my bad experience there last month and I regretted it. Both me and my boyfriend shared the same sentiments when we were done, that our masseurs did not seem to know what they were doing. My masseur just used her forearm through the entire massage and barely used pressure. When I did ask her to press harder, she seemed annoyed and she jammed her elbow on my back and pressed her whole body weight and didn't stop even when I was visibly struggling under her. I gasped and told her to stop. I gave up then and kept quiet through the entire massage. I now have big bruises on my back. Never coming back again.\n\n",

        "aslinda abd\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat massage, worth the money and time. Been a customer with them for about 4 years and the place is clean, professional masseuse and desk personnel. Even brought my mum and mum in law and both gave good feedback.\n\n",
        "Serene Low\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent there with my boyfriend had a 90mins massage and we both walked out with satisfaction. Some places I went to made me feel like the masseurs had no energy at all. Ancient dynasty was different, they made sure the pressure was right for you and they could go from firm to gentle depending on your needs. My partner forgot his necklace there so they rang him to let him know, very honest people I must say!!!\n\n",
        "Chanelle Koh\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBest massage i\u2019ve went to at Thomson.\nPrice wise is very affordable, but what\u2019s more is the skills of the therapists. Highly recommend their 2h Deep Tissue Oil Massage. I tried their grapefruit oil! Very nice aroma\uff0cdefinitely will come again!!!\n\n",
        "Sneha Tilak\nLocal Guide\u00b713 reviews\u00b734 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst visit here - had a 90mins full body massage. The masseuse LINA was really good. Also, we reached a bit late and the staff was very polite and accommodating. The place is clean and there are washrooms with showering facilities as well.\n\n",
        "G Sun\n5 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIf you dislike massage parlour that hard sells, then this is a shop that is not to be missed. The therapist is professional and will constantly adjust the pressure that is suitable for you. I paid $95 for a 2-hour massage with a premium top up for peppermint oil. This place provides value-for-money massage service. However, if you are looking for a high-end boutique style place, then it may not be your cup of tea.\n\n",
        "Xinyu Koh\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent with my husband and the massage we had at Ancient Dynasty was the most therapeutic deep tissue massage we've ever experienced. My massage was a perfect mixture of deep tissue and Swedish. We were so satisfied with the service that we scheduled another couples massage 2 days later. We highly recommend these massage therapist!\n\n",
        "Trevor Sim\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI went there as my lower back was very sore, I had tweaked it a few days earlier. I asked them to recommend a massage to help with this, which they did and before starting the massage the masseuse confirmed with me which area to focus on. They recommended Deep tissue massage which was very good and helped a lot in reducing my back pain. Will definitely come back again\n\n",
        "Sher Loh\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI called at 1am, and i still could get a massage! I love this place as you can come for midnight massages before you have a good sleep. Their affordable price and good massage skill really is very well done. Tried several at thomson, still came back to Ancient Dynasty. Thank you!\n\n",
        "Georgina Ong\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHave been a returning customer for several years, began my journey here with a foot massage, then full body massage then add on with hot stone as well. Have never looked back since then!\nThe team is professional, sincere, and friendly. No hardselling involved. Options are laid out for you, be informed but no obligations at all.\nSpoilt and pampered by their excellent services and massages.\n\n",
        "jUz anoOb\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWhile it may not be the best massage service i had, the overall service and friendliness i recieve was excellent. Its definately one of the cheapest good massage you can find in Singapore.\nThe environment is quiet with smoothing music, exactly what i was looking for after a long day work in office. Kudos to the management for the masseur i was appointed, really good as i requested one with strong hands for my back and neck.\nI will definitely return and recommend for the price and overall services.\n\n",
