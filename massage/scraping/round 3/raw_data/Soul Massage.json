Very nice, very friendly most importantly very genuine person I ever met in massage parlour. I honestly feel 5 star isn\u2019t enough for her. You should give it a try and you won\u2019t regret. She did a legit job. And I made her my personal masseuse till she is around. God bless.! Stay safe guys \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udcab\n\n",

        "Alexander Freickmann\n91 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nMassage itself was ok, but i booked 90 minutes and the massage lady totally lost track on time, so she just stopped in the middle of the massage. Would be okish for me, but after she left, i saw, that it was nearly exact 90min after the start. Considering she also went to the toilet during the session for 5min and that i never experienced such a hard stop in a better spa, felt disappointing. Take it also as a note tvat all ladies inside are from PRC and quite young.\nAll in all wouldn't recommend for a massage\n\n",
