        "Xavier Woon\n18 reviews\u00b734 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe staff in Golden Pail are very professional and skilled, especially the Lady Boss. Would highly recommend a visit if your body is feeling sore!\n\n",
        "Dilip Jayakumar\nLocal Guide\u00b745 reviews\u00b7120 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMassage worth every penny. The 90 minutes massage has free ear candling or body scrub too. The masseuses can speak basic English, good enough for you to let them know what kind of massage you need. Recommended and will be visiting again.\n\n",

        "Leo Mat\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad an awesome experience at the Golden Pail spa. I had crunched up my back and thigh muscles from an excercise session and was finding it really hard to walk or move around. Heard a lot of good reviews about Golden Pail Spa and wanted to try the place as it was close to where i was staying. Took a 90min Therapy session. The shower area, the bed and the surroundings were kept neat with extra towels. The therapist was sure to use the pressure points correctly to ease my back pain. Further more after the session, I was also given a back scrub within the 90 mins period. All in all, it was a 10/10 for me. The two most important aspects of this place, (i) the prices are reasonable compared to the other places around. (ii) The therapist was fully professional and NO naughty business, which made it easier for me as a guy to be comfortable. Thank you to the Golden Pail Spa team who made it an excellent experience for me. Will surely be dropping in the next time as well.\n\n",
        "Melody Soh\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe place to get a massage after a long day. The prices are reasonable and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The service staff are always courteous and accommodating. Been coming here at least once a week since they opened over a year ago. We\u2019re even friends with all the masseuse :-)\n\n",
        "Raymond Yong\nLocal Guide\u00b7183 reviews\u00b7203 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nNice and clean place for a hard massage. Friendly staff. Shower in every room so you can come here after your exercise, take a shower before your massage. English language may be an issue as the masseurs are mainly mainland Chinese and Vietnamese.\n\n",

        "LXO\n6 reviews\u00b716 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAs a frequent spa massuer lover myself, partly because of my perpetually stiff neck since young. I have embark on my journey of spa-exploration. since about 5 years ago.\nOut of the numerous shop I visit. (At least 40) Slowly I built a own \u201cgo-to-place\u201d list whenever I have a ache or just want to be pamper.\nOften I pass by this Golden Pail Spa but never walk in. Mainly because there isn\u2019t any\nThen one fine day, while trying to get a fix on my neck. I tried the massage there.\n\nGuess what. This is it\nThe hunt is over.\nThis is the place when I know I will get the massage that will relive my aching problem.\n\nInitially was on 1 hr + 1 hr.\nNot only the massuer who serve me was polite, attentive and meticulous from the Get-go. She also took extra attention in attending to the ouch and ahh of the sound that I couldn\u2019t help mumbling out when she hit the right spot.\n\nMain point, that night I slept well. (I have problem sleeping ever since divorced. ) nothing short of amazing, maybe is just me or some other experiences the same thing. Whatever it is they are doing. They are doing it right.\n\nDuring this covid period, it is also comforting to know that they are strict on the mask wearing, sanitise the rooms before and after i use. And strangers like me hanging around kept with social distancing.\n(I purposely stay a while more to see how is the rest of the environment like la.)\n\nIt been a Long time since I wrote a review, nonetheless I hope it serve it purpose.\n\nP.S) to add icing to the whole deal, because of the 2 hrS there is \u78e8\u7802 rub sand, it is like using scrub facial wash to wash your face but instead this is done to your whole body. I get to experience it for the first time too and wow.\n\nThis is why I say the hunt is over.\nKudos to the leader and the team for placing such importance to the customer like me and I gonna see you soon. :)\n\n",
        "Rayner Au\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHave been to Golden Pail SPA @ Thomson on weekly basis for body massage and occasionally for reflexology since October 2018. Their massage were consistently up to my expectation i.e. correct pressure and strength at right places. The staff there are friendly and I had welcoming feeling all the times. I guess I will continue with this routine foreseeable future.\n\n",
