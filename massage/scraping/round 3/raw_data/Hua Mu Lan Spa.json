I felt that I\u2019m chased out.\n\n",
        "Muneer Shah Mohammad Shah\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI was a regular here due to the number of masseurs here, especially the Malays they would have but everything just got worse. Staff counter don\u2019t bother answering the phone. Called 13x and I had to go down cause no one was answering. Next visit I went, I took Apple to massage me. During massaging, she made me release and expected me to pay her. I did not even ask for it and your staff has the cheeks to ask me for money? Is this how you staff should be?\n\n",
        "Yeo Henry\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe traditional deco of this place impressed me and I felt totally relaxed whenever I visit this place. Staffs (from boss, to receptionist to therapists) are very friendly. Strongly recommended for those who really enjoy a relax environment especially after a day of hard work. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n",

        "888XVX D\nLocal Guide\u00b726 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nCourteous receptionist gets one star.\n\nMassuesse (Yuki) starts off soft strokes with more talking than massaging, seems unable to do both properly at the same time.\n\nChose questionable positions while fishing for info. Constantly pushed more expensive package massage. After turning that down, attitude changed and then average massage\u2019s dropped to a fail and made it to the top of my DO NOT GO list.\n\n",
