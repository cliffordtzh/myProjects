        "Meneka Chand\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWas looking for a massage and chanced upon Livaspa. Wasn't expecting much given the price\n(1hr full body massage $50). But boy was i wrong!!! Called them up at 7.30am for 1 hr full body massage at 8.30pm for 2pax, requested for couple room too. We arrived at 8.10pm and was grreted by a very beautiful gal at the reception. She was quick to assign the room & massuers to us. They were Amy & Ivy. They were sooooo good!! Highly recommend them. Initially massage was abit too hard for me. Informed her and she applied just the right pressure. Will definitely come bk again!!! My husband can't stop talking about the massage. We had a really good night's sleep that night.\n\n",

        "tiongbahruboy\n2 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nThis is a no nonsense place. Good, clean massage. However, I didnt quite enjoy the massage though. The room I was allocated was next to the recep area and I could hear conversations outside. Room was dark and cosy. Massage a little on the hard side. Painful at times.\n\n",

        "JL T\n7 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nCame here without an appointment on a weekday afternoon. Read good reviews and wanted to have a massage that will help soothe soreness from my workout. My masseuse was a Chinese lady who applied the right amount of force and pressure on sore points. After that, I had the guasha treatment which supposedly helps relieve body \u201cheat\u201d and improve blood circulation. All in all my muscles felt looser after the massage session at Live Spa. Highly recommended for good quality, good value massage!\n\n",
        "Sarah Harrison\n19 reviews\u00b716 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nClean, quiet, friendly and not freezing - skilled masseur who responded well to pressure feedback. Will definitely go back for the price and service.\n\n",

        "K t\n16 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nDefinitely not worth it.\n\nMy friends did the massage, they told us 30 min for $28. Till they saw the banner outside 40 min for $28, so we asked them. They told us that they lack of manpower and only can massage 30 min after we had make the payment and finish everything. Nonsense.\n\nI did the facial, horrible. I do not mind it's a simple facial but the massage on the head it's horrible.\n\nWill never patron here again.\n\n",
        "Neo Dro\n8 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIvy was phenomenal and very professional \ud83d\udc4c her experience showed throughout the 90min session. Highly recommend this place for a deep tissue massage. It is very imp you communicate how much pressure you would like 'cos they are used to such long sessions but our bodies aren't, at least mine wasn't!\n\n",
        "Agathe\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have experienced three services in this spa (full body massage, foot massage and facial) and I'm very glad of them all. Michelle and Peipei are great therapists, and I highly recommend them. Plus, the manager is a really nice woman, always ready to help and advise you.\n\n",
        "Amanda w\nLocal Guide\u00b776 reviews\u00b729 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGet to know this place recently and it never disapoints me. It was a good place to get your foot massage and their skills are really very good. Prices are pretty reasonable and i will definitely drop down again to enjoy my foot massage! Nonetheless, people there are nice! :)\n\n",
        "Gaeul Ok\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI will not come here again. And i will definitely not recommend this massage place to my friends.\nOverall, massage skill was very bad. They should get training for better massage.\nIt was nothing more than \u201crubbing oil all over body\u201d.\nWhen i get massage, usually i feel \u201coh is it already over?\u201d. But this one was \u201coh god, when is it going to be over?\u201d.\nI don\u2019t know how other massage is (foot / shoulder). I got full body massage, and i can tell It is highly over rated place.\n\n",

        "E Chong\n8 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWent in for a 40mins foot massage. The lady at the counter said one of us have to wait 10mins while the other can start immediately. We said ok.\n\nAfter 20 mins of waiting, no one attended to us. I had to approach them to ask what\u2019s going on. We got a refund instead. Would not recommend this place. Lousy management given that no Masseuse were assigned to us after we made payment before the service.\n\n",

        "AJ M\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have been there a few times and i am really in love with the place. Firstly, the environment is cosy and located near Tiong Bahru hawker centre where there is also alot of good food. Their shop have free wifi, tv and provides water. Their aircon is also cooling! If you would like to drop by for massage on weekends, it is better to make a call to make a booking because it can be fully booked. Come if u like strong massage and able to request for not so strong massage if you would like to! :)\n\n",
        "Isabella\n14 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOne of the best places where you can find decent foot massage. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover though, the shopfront might look a little dodgy but the masseuse were so professional for me and my fianc\u00e9.\n\n",
