        "Xiao Yu Li\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHave been visiting this place for more than a year and the service provided is very good and constant. Price is lower than  most of the places in the market as well. Recommend.\n\n",
        "Wei Xiang Tay\nLocal Guide\u00b79 reviews\u00b7149 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery reasonably priced. Most importantly it is not just massage. Did a 45mins body massage for around S$30. The therapist was able to detect and fix my strained traps. He was also able to rub down all the knots that I had. As good as new the next day. The shop provides foot massage too.\n\n",

The environment is clean and comfortable. The main thing is that the price is really cheap.
