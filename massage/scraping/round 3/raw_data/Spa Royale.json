        "Robin Ng\n2 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nA new and nicely renovated spa with great ambience. Pricing is reasonable. Receptionist was friendly.\n\nHad my massage by Anna. The best masseur I ever met. Pretty, polite, very professional and skillful. She does not rush for her job. Tensed and tired body was feeling relaxed after the massage. Tipped her in appreciation for her hard work. Will definitely visit her again.\n\n",
