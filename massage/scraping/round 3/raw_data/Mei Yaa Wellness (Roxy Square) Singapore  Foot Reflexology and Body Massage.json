        "ven y s a tee\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAlways a pleasure! They are using masks and gloves during the whole process. At the beginning feels a bit weird but after 5 min... U feel in heaven! \u2764\ufe0f Thanks, Peter for his experience massage.\n\n",
        "Belinda Yap\n10 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDone a 60mins foot massage by a lady masseur and I went back again the following day for 60mins full body massage with the same masseur. She was friendly and professional. No hard sell at all. Highly recommended.\n\n",
        "Elgin Lam\nLocal Guide\u00b734 reviews\u00b770 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI'm quite a big guy so it's hard to find a place that gives me good massage. The messeus here is so good I followed him when he was still at the Bedok South location. He uses strength at just the right parts, and really helps me relax after a long week. I can't recommend this place enough.\n\n",

However, friends who are not able to do so should remember to remind the masseur about the intensity, haha. Arguably one of the best massage services I have tried in Singapore. \"Service\" value for money\n\n(Original)\n\u5730\u70b9\u6709\u70b9\u9690\u79d8\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u6309\u6469\u5e08\u5374\u5f88\u68d2\uff01\u529b\u63a8\u8fd9\u5bb6\uff01\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4e0d\u53d7\u529b\u7684\u670b\u53cb\u8981\u8bb0\u5f97\u63d0\u9192\u6309\u6469\u5e08\u529b\u5ea6\u54e6\uff0c\u54c8\u54c8\u3002\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bf4\u662f\u6211\u5728\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u8bd5\u8fc7\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6309\u6469\u670d\u52a1\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u201c\u52a1\u201d\u8d85\u6240\u503c\n\n",
