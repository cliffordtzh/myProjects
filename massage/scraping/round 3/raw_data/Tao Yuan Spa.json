        "Julie Reakes\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI visited on a Saturday afternoon with no booking, paid and went in for my massage. My therapist came in and I said hello as she didn't say anything then she replied with an unenthusiastic hello. No name given. Until she said to turn over, that was all she said until I was told the massage was over.\n\nAt times when I was face down, the massage went limp and repetitive and I wondered if she was on her phone. When I turned over, her phone was on the stool she got up from.\n\nThe massage was 3/10 in terms of quality. The oil had no aroma and it was a $75 aromatherapy massage I decided to have as a treat. It was no treat!\n\nWhen I got dressed, I checked the time as it felt a short massage. It was 6:58 and my payment receipt showed 5:59, making a 60 min appointment impossible unless the till was wrong but from memory it seemed right. I mentioned it to the receptionist but she just shrugged it off. I didn't bother to show her the receipt and just left. The man inquiring about a massage also left!\n\nLooking on this website now, it seems the aim of this spa is not for women to have a good massage. I couldn't recognise my therapist on the website. It was a shame my experience was so poor, as its close to where I live and the surroundings were nice and the music in the room was relaxing.\n\nMaybe a man will get a better experience.\n\n",
        "John Tay\n5 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nFirst time there and chose Qiqi. Biggest regret. She is unfriendly and doesnt speak much with a big attitude problem. Be careful not to get scammed also. just a heads up.\n\n",
        "L\u00e8s Hermano\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time went there, good massage by thailand woman feel much better after massage. Clean enviroment, polite customer service. Will recommend to some friends.\n\n",

Right now, I felt so much recharged to get back to work!\nFor those not tried this treatment before, I highly recommend it!\nAnd there's free parking here as well.\nBest to call and make appointment before heading down to avoid wait and crowd.\n\n",

        "Chan Maggie\n2 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\n1st time visit, they assigned a new therapist to me... Paid for hotstone massage at premium price but no hotstone at all. I asked why no hotstone when the therapist said the massage was done. She told me that as most of the customers feedback that hotstone is too hot.. so she didn\u2019t do it for me. Ridiculous!\n\nAfter few mins waiting for their investigation, reception said her boss agreed to pay me back few dollars GST as compensation... WTH! I am requesting for hotstone massage but got a cheaper one, nothing about GST... finally, I have to initiate to just get compensation for the difference of hotstone and normal aroma massage to settle the case.\n\nSo, No next Time for me!\n\n",

        "Wong Desmond\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVisited this spa along 531 Balestier Road  opposite Zhong Shan mall ,probably the best around this area. Young and cheerful genuine experienced masseuse leading you into clean and cosy rooms with soft music, all with attached bath. Appreciate their efforts to keep the place organized and well lit. Importantly the masseuse is never rushing for time, even with a bit of overrun.\n\n",

        "Larry Lam\nLocal Guide\u00b736 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nThe photos of the girls here are just models to attract guys, don't be fooled by it. In fact the photos of the girls working only initially when they open many years ago! Don't expect same if you think you want similar standards of girls serving you!\n\n",
