As the shop name suggests, everyone here is hard of sight. The shop interior is dim/dark. The massage was FANTASTIC. Got myself a 45min foot and 45min shoulder massage for a cool $50. Definitely coming back here again.\n\n",
        "Sharon Eng\nLocal Guide\u00b714 reviews\u00b716 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nReally good place to get a massage! Especially after sitting at the desk all day. The prices are unbeatable, the therapists are skilful and the place is neat and tidy. The best thing is that you will be supporting dignified work for persons with visual disabilities. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nUpdate: My shoulder ache disappeared the next day! So impressed I\u2019m gonna go back every week!\n\n",

The price is exceptional for the level of quality I get. I have chronic pain in my leg due to an injury in the past and I am quite physically active. The masseuse are visually impaired, but their heighten sense of touch allows them to know where exactly on your body requires more attention. Really excellent place to get a no to thrift massage.\n\n",

Its different from your regular spa massage since amenities are basic but the skills of the masseuse is top notch, they can target all the right and sore spots with precision with the right amount of force.

        "Adrian Soh\nLocal Guide\u00b78 reviews\u00b713 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nHappened to be in the area and was looking for a place to soothe a backache. Better than expected. Did a 60min back and 60mins foot massage. Was there slightly after lunch hour and just before the crowd came. Lucky to be able to get my massages without having to wait. Will be back again\n\n",

        "Nurul Mimsy\nLocal Guide\u00b772 reviews\u00b7300 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHonestly one of the best massage sessions that I\u2019ve had. The place isn\u2019t of spa standards but it\u2019s the technique and friendly service that would make me return to this place. The prices are also very affordable for the services that are offered.\n\nI\u2019m really happy to see a place like this where our visually impaired friends can have an opportunity to find an honest living. I hope one day, you guys will be so successful that you can franchise and open multiple outlets across Singapore. Keep up the good work! \u2764\ufe0f\n\n",
        "Leroy Koh\n2 reviews\u00b79 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent for a 60 minute head shoulders and neck massage in the evening with my girlfriend. I made an appointment the previous day through SMS with the phone number listed on their Facebook page and glad I did because the place was packed; for a good reason\n\nThe services rendered are professional, no frills and to the point. Once we got started, I let the masseuse (Richard) know about pains/tightness I was experiencing and he began pressing away, all whilst asking if the massage was ok. Funny question by him because it was a great massage, felt A LOT of relief in my back and shoulders immediately after.\n\nWill be returning here regularly and trying out the full body and foot massages!! I\u2019m sure I won\u2019t be disappointed :)\n\n",
        "Lau Sherwin\n4 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFuss-free but excellent- there probably isn't anywhere else providing comparable service at such prices and location. They don't use oils, so you can even pop by before an appointment in town. I suggest calling ahead if you're going on a weekend (I go almost every other week), and ask for Desmond (my go-to). Enjoy!\n\n",
        "Esther Ong\nLocal Guide\u00b746 reviews\u00b714 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery skillful masseuses. Just from massaging, they could tell my tight muscle issues and did their best to loosen it.\n\n",

        "Amy Ling\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nPopped by for a random massage and was assigned Kim. Did a 30 mins shoulder + 30 mins foot massage for $30. Value for money. Kim was skilful and exerted good pressure on my aching calves. Massage was better than I had expected! It was my first and definitely not my last visit \ud83d\udc4d\n\n",

        "Isabel Phua\n1 review\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED and must go!\nNo regrets. Don't expect spa environment but the deal is the skill, point and technique. Amazing massage. Tried the full body massage.\nAll the points on point.\nAll the knots not there.\nSuch relieve and baby sleep after the massage. Staff were also very understanding to keep volume minimal and not chit chatting during the massage. Best I've every tried from oil to deep tissue to lymphatic etc, this massage is the best and will definitely return and make this my regular spot.\n\n",
        "Melissa Koh\n9 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFriendly, no sales pressure vibe. Kept checking back if the pressure points were OK for me and encouraged me to voice out if not. I went 2 times in a week. Cured my sore shoulders. Looking forward to going back!\n\n",

I have tried so many massage places all around Singapore and this is the only place I keep coming back. You do need to book ahead especially on the weekend since they get quite packed. Please give them a try if you are looking for a good no frill massage!\n\n",
        "Teresa Lo\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat service as usual and very friendly people. I don't usually post reviews but I just felt very bad when I heard about customers who made booking but did not turn up and did not pick up the phone when the masseur called to check if the customers are coming. As a result they lost income for that hour as they turned down a few walk-in enquiries as they reserved the slot for the customers who did not turn up in the end. Do call them to inform if there is any change to your plans and they will appreciate that. Richard was very patient to help with my sore neck and shoulder. Thank you!\n\n",
        "Eveline How\nLocal Guide\u00b716 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat massage by blind masseurs who want to use their skills for their own livelihood. Wee Sin, Pin Pin, Swee Tin, Desmond, and their team are trained to do foot reflexology and body massage. I find myself alternating between foot massage, shoulder and back massage, and full body massage (fully clothed). Text for a time slot and Wee Sin will reply quickly. Appointments are highly recommended as they can get busy.\n\n",

        "E Lee\n7 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis place offers great massages at reasonable prices. Tried the shoulder-feet bundle and both areas. especially the shoulders felt much better afterwards. The shoulder massage includes brief massages of the head and arms. Shifu who did the massage was skilful and friendly, as were the other staff of the place - friendly, humourous and good at what they do.\n\nDefinitely worth repeated visits.\n\n",

Both were amazing \ud83d\ude0a She expertly knows where to press with the right amount of pressure. She has great customer service - asking where I would like to focus on, and even asking if I am wearing slippers/shoes to see if she needs to wipe down my feet. And for $55 for 90min - what value for money!!! Do support them!!\n\n",
        "Jason Lim\nLocal Guide\u00b7132 reviews\u00b7798 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWell I am a repeated customer here.

Value for money but best part is able to support the disabled in the society and encourage them to work\n\n",
        "S T\nLocal Guide\u00b7153 reviews\u00b7198 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nChance upon this place while having food at tanjong pagar food center. Not your atypical massage place. The staffs are visually impaired. Why they special then? It is their non discriminating way of serving customer. In a typical place. Most other operators will judge you via your physical build and deploy unusual heavy strength and thus sometime resulted in bruising.\nThis place however is different, 3 of my attempts were greeted with masseuse who consistently ask about the area of concern and will consistently kneeling out the stuff muscle. Result: painless smooth out muscle.\n\nExpect long queue and turn away for walking customer. please do call 1 day in advance for arrangement.\nAlso good note to ask for their name for future return.\nThey are generally nice chatter. Make their day great and they will make your greater.\n\n",
