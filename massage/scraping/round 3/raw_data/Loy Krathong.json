        "Anthony\n16 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI don\u2019t say this lightly\u2026 but this is the best massage I\u2019ve ever had in Singapore. Masseurs here are incredibly skilled and I\u2019ll definitely be back. As the saying goes, \u2018Felt like I\u2019ve got a new back\u2019\n\n",
        "cessy cat\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nA very relaxing place. Cheap and affordable. Look for June, a Chinese lady, she did a great job! Will come back again. Sure!\n\n",
        "Muso Lee\nLocal Guide\u00b7778 reviews\u00b72,240 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nMy massuer was alright. But it was damn noisy. The place looks like a Thai massage place but it didn't have the Thai polite and peaceful culture. This place is run by Malaysian Chinese and they speak loudly making the entire experience a pain. They do not understand the meaning of total relaxation which we all go for. Hence it is a Malaysian business but faking to be a Thai massage parlour.\n\n",

        "Benjamin Teo\nLocal Guide\u00b755 reviews\u00b764 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHonestly one of the better massage places I've been to. The 90mins full body massage goes for $70 which is really competitive in terms of pricing.\n\nThe massuers I had for the last 2 visits though different but both gave a very good deep Thai styled massage.\n\n",
        "Sandy S.\n13 reviews\u00b718 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nCame here without checking the reviews cos my friend said it\u2019s top 3 Thai massage palour in Sg. I had hands down the WORST experience ever! My masseur is a China Chinese. I have no words to describe how bad her skills are. If they continue using this woman, this shop should just cease to operate! 1 hour of Thai massage felt like I\u2019m being tortured. She\u2019s pressing my bones , no \u2018cracking\u2019 of my bones thankfully else I think she will probably dislocate them instead of relieving any pain/stress that I have. Geez!!!! Never had such bad massage ever in Sg!\n\n",
        "Michael Naert\n3 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nreservation was good, reception friendly and the place is clean. My therapist was clumsy and rough though. I asked several times to not do something and yet she kept doing the same. It was more stomping and pinching than massage ... my girlfriend who was next to me was quite happy about her therapist though, nevertheless i will not return here.\n\n",
        "Lyn Su\nLocal Guide\u00b711 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAffordable foot massage and experienced massage therapist! 2nd visit, and they did not disappoint. Fixed all the aches in my feet and they definitely do not play when it comes to strength. If you're expecting fancy spa music with top tier service, this is not the place. But if you just want to get the job done with friendly staff then yes, I will reccomend this spot :)\n\n",
        "Yee Miao Sim\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\u00b729 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nNot for fussy customers,  for example massage bed is on floor. Simple deco,  clean and because I found a masseur who is very patient & good to locate pain spots,  I continue to go!\n\n",
        "Someone Here\nLocal Guide\u00b724 reviews\u00b79 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOne of the best massage place around.\n\nPrice wise, on point.\nMasseur, tried alot. All are very skillful.\n\n",
        "Andy Low\nLocal Guide\u00b7121 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nProfessional, clean and authentic thai massages. It's really affordable too. I come here regularly for massages for sport-induced muscle soreness. Highly recommended.\n\nUpdate: Went for a full body massage and the masseuse kept kneading directly on my bones despite telling her it really hurts. I was wincing throughout the whole session. Now my entire back and arms hurts from the massage. Disappointed!\n\n",
        "\u5b64\u5bc2\u65e0\u5948\n2 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nThe volume of employees talking and looking at their mobile phones is too loud, completely disregarding customers' feelings.\n\n",
        "Vivienne Teo\nLocal Guide\u00b7108 reviews\u00b760 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt is a decent place for good deep tissue thai massage. I took 90 mins oil massage for $75.\n\n",
        "Gopinath Govindaraj\nLocal Guide\u00b797 reviews\u00b7123 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGood place for a pain relieving massage. This place relieved my long-term neck and back pain. Pit-fall, they speak very little English. Nonetheless, highly recommended.\n\n",
        "Or chee koon\n361 reviews\u00b7200 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe place is old but clean, had a good and hard massage, not easy to find in Singapore .\n\n",
        "A Google User\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nit is a great place for a good thai or oil massage that will release all tensions. All therapists are very detailed and experienced. i especially enjoy and recommand joy. after trying many massages in singapore n even thailand..joy is still the best\n\n",
        "Ching T\nLocal Guide\u00b783 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nNo frills sort of place, but the masseurs all mean business. If you need a good (completely monkey business-free) pounding and ironing out, this is the place to get it. If you're the fragile sort that needs gentle handling, don't try your luck.\n\n",
        "Marijn de Vries Hoogerwerff\nLocal Guide\u00b7246 reviews\u00b71,155 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nnice no-nonsense place, very tough massage, but sometimes thats exactly what you need, they got the skills. Place in the back for a shower is ok, but the steam bath was just a hot damp room.\n\n",
