        "William Leong\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe ambient is good, a tranquil and relax feeling.  A Massage Therapist- Lily, which I have frequent quite a few times does have good massage skills. She will make you feel relax for the one or one and half session, depending on your request session period. You will definitely have a pleasurable experience with her massage therapist skills and before you know it, the session is up. Yup, definitely a good recommendation for her.\n\n",
        "Adrian Cheng\nLocal Guide\u00b762 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nPoor massage skills. Would never go again.\n\n",
        "Aaron Chan\n37 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThis is undoubtedly the worst massage I ever go for in my life, which I regretted patronizing. I was requesting for full body aroma oil massage. However, the masseuse insisted that that for the price I am paying for would merely be normal massage. The overall massage session was neither relaxing or a pleasant one for me. Before and after the massage just makes no difference at all, my bodyache still persists and it doesn't alleviate any of the associated pain. Most of the time, she tried to utilise her cold-calling strategies to make me do unnecessarily expensive treatment as to profiteer, which I don't give a budge. And moreover the service attitude was extremely bad and below my satisfaction.This is one of the most costly lesson for me for such a substandard and ineffective massage. Once before but never again and I going. Hope potential patrons do take note.\n\n",
        "Des Ong\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHi guys, I was recommended to try out the service here. It didnt disappoint. I came in tired and came out refreshed. I was also recommended to try a masseur- Lily, which, she was the main reason, besides the smoothing ambient, that has refreshed me up. She is patient, know where to apply the right pressure, attractive and friendly. It was really a good experience compared to other places. I have become her regulator ever since visited her the first time few months ago. I am sharing this few months later because to see whether she maintain her consistency or not, and she didnt fail. A must try type. Enjoy your service guys\ud83d\ude0a\n\n",

        "Nik\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nmassage there is no where close to even an average massage. In one hour session they will massage you only for 10-15 mins rest of the time they will spend going in /out of the room getting towels etc. Too noisy and for not even a single minute you will feel pampered. Try your luck and ask for h**** end.\n\n",
