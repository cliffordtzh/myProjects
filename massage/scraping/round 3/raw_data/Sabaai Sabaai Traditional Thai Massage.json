        "Chia Joel\nLocal Guide\u00b7282 reviews\u00b74,421 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOne of the best thai massage places you can find here in singapore.\n\nSuper clean place - nice robes for you to change into, toilet though a bit small was clean - had kirei kirei!\n\nThough prices are a little premium as compared to overseas or in JB. You really get a quality full body thai traditional Thai massage that will leave you wanting more.\n\nThey have a chop system as well as you can collect and get discounts if you are a loyal returning customer...\n\nDefinitely book a slot and try it for yourself!\n\n75 for an hour of Thai traditional massage!\n\nOnly bummer is that somehow their payment system doesn't accept contactless paywave options and you have to bring your physical credit card if you'll like to use your credit card to pay!\n\n",

        "CHAE U RI LEE\n2 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI took \u201c30 minutes/ foot massage. \u201c\n\nI'd like to make a reservation at 8 pm. But at 7:13 pm the massage club called me and said \u201c8 pm is full booking, so I have to come by 7:30 pm.\u201d\n\nI called on time without being late. I visited at the time they wanted, hoping for better service. (If they had at least the average massage level, I wouldn't have written this review.)\n\nAt The first time it wasn't bad. (Greeting service, beverage service etc..)\nDesk staff were friendly and beverage service was good. And the tea was also good.\n\u2014\n< Foot Massage started. >\n\n* massage\nThe first pressure to me for left foot massage was weak and insincere.\nI majored in art, knows a little bit of anatomy. Also Massage experience is a lot as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the pressure is too weak to a viable level for baby. (This is not a massage, just touching.)\n\nBut I did not say any compliments at first.\n\nBecause I thought there will be the therapist\u2019s intention or purpose of the first time introduction stage and still believe.....\n\n15 minutes left. To be honest, At that time feel bad. (There\u2019s no therapist\u2019s intention or purpose. She just... It became apparent that the time was being spent by forcefully.)\n\nBut the therapist condition is good or thought there may be many other reasons.. So I told her\nsoftly, just \u201cpress more than the left foot.\u201d\n\nThe right foot was better than the left touch level. I'm not satisfied with my right side, but I'm just touching my left foot.\n\nI thought I waste of money and time.\n\nNo difference whatsoever after the massage are tired of the foot and calf.\n\n< 5 minutes left. >\n\nI saw a new guest wash her by other therapist.\n\nSo I ask the my therapist.\n\n\u201cWhy I never wash my feet like her?\u201d\nThen my therapist replied.\n\u201cBecause I am taking a half-hour massage. And\nthis massage is not included the washing feet service. So I took just wash your feet as a wet towel.\nIf you want to wash your feet service,\nYou have to pay an additional $ 10. Would you take a feet washing service?\n\nThe massage was only five minutes remaining in. (Also, If the foot service is not to be included in a 30-minute period, the massage club or therapist should have made the announcement beforehand.)\n\nWast time and money...\n\nIf I was satisfied with today, I would visit again tomorrow with my friend, but I never will. Never go.\n\n",

Still  reasonable pricing. Previous review: $68 for 60mins. Jasmine: recommend for females (medium strength) Great masseur, know what she's doing. Went for traditional Thai massage (no oil) and she helped relieved many knots which I didn't even know I had! Bought a package for $620 (10 times) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\n",

        "Timothy Wong\n18 reviews\u00b710 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nCame here on 2 separate occasions to try out both Thai Traditional and Thai Signature. Thai Traditional was quite the typical Thai massage but I personally prefer the Thai Signature because you'll be stretched in parts of your body that you didn't know could be stretched. It really helps to ease the tension and relieves the pressure. Came out feeling so much better. I didn't get the name of the masseur, and although she wasn't Thai, her massage was on point. Pressure was just perfect - Not too soft and not too painful. Prices are on the higher end but still affordable. I think 60-90 minutes is fine but 120 minutes would be too long.\n\n",
        "Selene\nLocal Guide\u00b723 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent in for 2 times. The first one was Traditional massage and second for Aroma. The massage is good, but the lobby area is quite small. So it does affect the whole experience. A tiny cup of drink before and after was provided, which I do appreciate, but it does feel like a miniature version of the ritual.\n\n",

        "\u5289GS\nLocal Guide\u00b781 reviews\u00b739 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVery good.\n\nAlthough, having been to authentic massage places in the rest of Southeast Asia, I wouldn't say this is the best experience I've ever had. 4 out of 5 stars is a fair rating in my opinion.\n\nFor the casual inexperienced customer, definitely do try out this place.\n\nFor the experienced customer, expect to be satisfied but not wowed or amazed or blown away.\n\nPrices are pretty standard, given the location. (Cheaper in Malls definitely.)\n\nDo try to call in advance to check if they have a slot, rather than turning up and just trying your luck -- especially if you're going in a group (more than one person).\n\n",

        "Fernando Er\n9 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI didn\u2019t have the best experience in June 2018, but\n\n1) in receiving sincere responses from the proprietress about my then-experience (representative of the brand\u2019s customer service: even after 2 years, the Thai receptionist still extends warm attention at entry and exit; though I see so much less of her now),\n\n2) the absence of the problem that had once been a big source of my then-discontent (as of late, I haven\u2019t experienced any issue with extreme temperatures from the central air-conditioning), and\n\n3) in having since encountered a most competent, durable therapist who has always been diligent and consistent (from the 4 times I had the good fortune of scheduling her to my sessions) in expertly applying her massage techniques compatible with my bodily dispositions, I figured it\u2019s high time to join the 5-star band wagon and revise my original, less than stellar review; it\u2019s only\nright.\n\nA very good place for bone cracking and muscle relaxing relief; as always, the head/face massage still remains the cherry on top of the proverbial cake, but, now, with a trustworthy therapist to lend her hands, each individual aspect of the massage has since been elevated into a distinct, praiseworthy experience that accrues into a satisfying whole.\n\nI am not sure if the complimentary salt foot scrub is still limited only to bookings (i.e., not available to walk-ins); so best call and check. But it seems that the offers of the welcome lime-blue pea flower drink and exit ginger tea are still valid customary practices.\n\n",
        "YiYin Wang\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe most  therapeutic massage from my personal experience, thanks to masseuse Yan-Yan.\n\nI had a 90 mins aroma oil massage during the promotion period, and was very impressed by the whole journey of it.\n\nFrom the very first second I could tell Yan-Yan knows how to control the pressure, connecting points to points smoothly, I found it tremendously important when a massage is well choreographed, almost in sync with my breath, it wasn't only spot on, precise, it feels effortlessly perfect.\n\nThe only thing is that the lobby seems quite small, and possibly due to the busy appointments, I can feel staffs rushing in and out a bit, however the ambience is ok.\n\nAs for the massage space, it is charming and cozy, maybe authentic thai style? Despite can hear voices from customer next to you, I feel the sheet on the floor relaxing enough.\n\nThank you so much Sabaai Sabaai and Yan-Yan, it was a wonderful afternoon besides the quay. See you soon.\n\n",
        "Martin Santoso\nLocal Guide\u00b7225 reviews\u00b7445 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAwesome massage place. Tried their non oil massage for 1 hour and was super relaxed after the treatment. The place is also super clean, and courteous staff. You'd be served welcome drink which is refreshing as well. The masseuse is also considerate and will ask the you the strength of the massage from to time. Felt asleep for some time, without realizing one hour went by. Will try their 1.5 hour next time. Recommended! Reservation is needed because is popular place.\n\n",

        "Amirah Rahmat\n7 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThai traditional ($75-60mins) vs Thai Signature ($85-60mins)\nI tried both massages to check out what makes a signature different from a traditional one. To me, the traditional one is normal/standard as you get which is great, but, holy cow the signature one is just out of this world. My body gets the best crack I've ever had in any massage place. Kudos to the thai masseuse who massaged me so well! I requested for medium-high level of massage.\n\n",

        "Cherin C\nLocal Guide\u00b720 reviews\u00b782 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFound this place by chance through google map as it was nearby to where we are settling for a dinner. Booking of an appointment with them was a breeze through email, reply came promptly and communication was clear throughout, we booked 90mins for their thai aromatherapy \ud83d\ude0a\n\nWe arrive early for our appointment, receptionist politely informed us to return when nearing our appointment time as there were safe distancing measures in place and there is not much space to accommodate too many people.\n\nWhen we return, we were directed to their sofa to fill up their health declaration form through our phone, took a quick 5mins to do so. Then they washed our feet and we waited for our turn to enter the room.\n\nThey do not have a couple room, the room is an open concept with curtains as a divider between each person like how they do so in Thailand.\n\nThe curtain was thick, lights were dimmed, there was a loose dress to change into, I have no idea how to tie it and the therapist helped me with it \ud83e\udd23\n\nMassage was awesome \ud83d\udc4f, I felt instantly relaxed that I almost went into deep sleep! Pricing is alittle high ($115 nett) but it was very worth it. I felt recharged and feel lighter after the massage, definitely a place that I would return \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\nI love how skilful the therapist was, strength was good, relieved my tension on my shoulder and back, aroma oil used was nice smelling too \ud83d\ude0c\n\nThe only down side is the sound of foot steps, I was situated near the entrance door, thus everyone who enter/leave I can hear them \ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, a little distracting but the massage always pull me back to relax \ud83d\ude06\n\n",

Didn't expect to see so many Singaporean names on the registration list as the massage prices are steep as compared to nearby SEA countries. I'd say it's worth it!\n\n",

She pressed hard but not on the right spots so it just felt awkward and painful instead of relieving. Also felt like she did not have enough strength to pull me or lift me in assisted stretches. Paying $75 and picking a place with such great reviews, I had higher expectations before the massage, but it turns out to be much worse than a Thai massage you can get at a street corner in Bangkok.\n\n",

This is definitely my favourite go to massage place, they are usually busy advisable to book in advance. Beautiful interior and place is always very clean. Love the foot scrub before the session starts. Never disappoint!\n\n",
        "Kristen Haddon\nLocal Guide\u00b77 reviews\u00b723 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nExceptionally clean and professional massage center. I highly recommend the foot massage and thai aroma massage. A foot wash/scrub and cool tea is a welcome treat upon arrival. After your service a hot ginger tea. A reservation is highly recommended as they are popular. I will definitely visit again next time in Sing!\n\n",
        "Santanu Bhattacharya\n11 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWe took the traditional Thai massage and everything was perfect from start to finish. Most important was the skill level of the masseuses which was excellent. The place was neat and tidy and well located. Much recommended\n\n",
        "Sean Gill\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time for Thai Massage and loved it.  Very different from Swedish or Deep Tissue massage that I'm used to.  This was almost like a guided stretching that is done to you.  It was great, we made reservations to go back before the end of our trip.\n\n",
        "Nisha Neurgaonkar\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI decided to go for a traditional Thai massage at Sabaai Sabaai only because a very close friend of mine was visiting from India and she insisted that we should go. At first, I was reluctant because I didn't want to be covered in oil and then spend time in the shower getting that off me when I could rather spend that time doing something else. But I was completely wrong about that! This massage does not involve any oil. We were given a lose top and pyjamas to wear and led to relax in these cozy little tent like structures instead of a typical massage room. Not only was this massage extraordinarily good but it made me feel like I was floating in the air by the end of it. It felt like someone was doing yoga for me with my body, making me feel relaxed at the same time. The masseuse was very professional and paid special attention to the pain points, maintaining the pressure as per my instructions. The best part for me was right at the end when she had me in the bench pose fully supporting me from behind and applying pressure at the perfect places of my neck, back and shoulders, which entirely de-stressed my spinal cord. I would highly recommend Sabaai Sabaai to everyone. A truly soothing and blissful experience and appropriately priced too.\n\n",
        "Peter Peh\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nWent for the 90mins Thai traditional massage. Normal standard, satisfaction is below the ones u have in Thailand or even JB.\n\n",
        "Sasha Bao\nLocal Guide\u00b735 reviews\u00b762 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAlways a great experience here for the 1h Thai massage. In case you didn't know, Thai massages are done on a flat bed on the ground, and involves thumb and palm pressure, stretching and even body weight pressure. Although not the best for relieving knots, the acupressure and stretching style is very very relaxing and rejuvenating. Sgd 68 for 1h full body massage.\n\n",
        "Jimilee McCleskey\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nLoved the chair massage so much that I decided to give the Thai massage a try 2 days later! Friendly staff, clean, and she hit all the right spots. Plan on going back a 3rd time before I return to the US.\n\n",
        "Peace &Love\n1 review\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nThe \u201cOwner\u201d Left a standard reply however,  did not give his/her proper name just a random email.   We don\u2019t have time to advise you on how to run a proper facility and give value for the outrageous prices that are charged for such poor service.\n\nWe are still trying to figure out how this place has recieved such high reviews. - my partner and I recently visited for head , neck and shoulder massage.   The website says free foot scrub however it\u2019s 10 more.   We were taken to an area where the AC was blasting on one side and warmer on another side we opted for the warmer part as we both had stiff necks from the AC at the hotel.  We still needed to request blankets as our feet were still exposed to the freezing cold blast of the AC.  not comfortable at all.\n\nThe massage area was a floor and thin mat ,for a head neck and shoulder appointment it felt odd right away however , we both figured they must have a special technicique  they didn\u2019t, the  masseuse was completely out of tune to my needs and did her own thing.  She was rubbing the same spot on my head over and over for 10 min. I had to ask her several times to rub elsewhere however i don\u2019t think she spoke English.  she left my head both numb and irreatated   I can honestly say I\u2019ve had better massages on a Bangkok street corner for 10 bucks.  We left there 140 poorer and in worst shape than we arrived.  I would not recommend this place.\n\n",
        "Xinjia Li\n8 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nMy 4th time at Sabaai Sabaai. Quality of massage is still good but the customer service from the staff at the front desk seem to have dipped. We called to book a 60min Thai massage for 2 and when we almost reached, someone called to say that there was only one bed hence only one person can do the full body massage and suggested the other to do a foot, neck and shoulder massage instead. Whilst this is not ideal (we really wanted a full body massage) , we accepted as we were almost at the destination. I decided to my husband go with the full massage instead. As I have plenty of neck and shoulder aches I asked if I could have more focus on these areas like 30 mins out of the 60mins massage if possible. But I was told quite unkindly by Sirina Nang at the reception that this is not possible, their time for the neck and shoulder portion is fixed at 15 mins and they can't do anymore than that. This is rather bewildering as most massage place could allow you to focus on certain areas. Again I asked OK how about 20mins surely 5 mins more would not make a difference. Sirina was like no, not possible. Literally \u201cNot Possible\u201d. I offered to pay a little more thinking that maybe it's the money then she said you can pay for 30 min shoulder massage for $48 and then 30 min foot massage for $50 if you want that. This comes up to $98 and the full body massage which I originally wanted and didn't get due to their mistake was only $75. I felt penalised for their mistake and to top it off Sirina was very unfriendly throughout. At this point I got rather upset and told her she had a poor attitude and I really don't see how that request of mine to allocate 5 mins more of the massage to the neck and shoulder was \u201cnot possible\u201d.Then I added that I am ready to send feedback on this. Suddenly she changed track and was like 20mins is fine. Now it's suddenly possible. I feel indignant that they did not care about a simple customer request unless the customer was ready to escalate it.\n\nAgain to be fair, the massage was good but I gave a overall low score because it was a very unpleasant experience with Sirina. The most important thing of any spa is to leave feeling relaxed and I did not have that.\n\nPlease look into your front desk staff, dont let them be a disservice to your therapist.\n\n",

At one point, there was a misunderstanding on my credit card charge and I found the team to be cooperative and quick to resolve my concerns (the issue appeared to be to do with my bank rather than sabaai sabaai). I found the manager was responsive and respectful at all times.  Although I was already out of the country when this happened, the issue was addressed with top priority. Sabaai Sabaai is a massage place I can trust. Will definitely come back.\n\n",

I askd the reception if it was the same outlet. She said it was, and I was accompanied to this next place. This turned out to be a very noisy massage place, I booked an hour but the chap was finished after 50 minutes, and disappeared as soon as he was done. The experience was not nice.\n\n",

As yesterday was raining heavily, we were late for our appt but Sabai Sabai staff was so accommodating that they push out appt to 10:30pm. We got caught up in the rain and as soon as we reached Sabai Sabai, a Malay staff ask me if I need a towel to warm myself up! How nice it was to be welcome like that. The massage was no doubt a good one. Definitely coming back again!\n\n",
