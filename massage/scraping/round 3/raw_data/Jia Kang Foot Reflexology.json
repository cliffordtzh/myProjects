        "Lay Ling Koh\n1 review\u00b74 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nJohn is extremely professional and approachable. In fact I personally believe he's the best foot masseur in Singapore. I've been diligently patronising his foot massage services and found him to be extremely spot on with problem areas. He always apply the right pressure and manages my pain point very well over intelligent and humorous conversations. Foot reflexology is a discipline which can be reflective of the level of health, wellness and lifestyle. He displays depth of knowledge when encountering any problem areas and I found his advice to be very useful. 10-Star treatment at affordable prices!!\n\n",

Will come back again def!:)\n\n",

        "CN\n1 review\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI found this place through recommendation and decided to try out their foot massage.\n\nMy heart warms when I step in this place.\n\nFoot reflex service was great. Not too strong, just nice and not out-to-kill-you ouch.\n\nYan enjoyed the foot bath and hope to try out head, neck and shoulder massage on my next visit.\n\nKeep up the good service and don't forget requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace.\n\nYou have yan continual support.\n\n",
        "Yoomia Sim\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt's my second time returning to see John. I receive sports massages regularly to maintain / relax my muscles from all the travelling and performing I do. I am very picky with who I go and see. I must say John is one of the best massage therapist I have had so far, true professional, he uses acupressure points and he is very knowledgeable. I am returning back in five days to receive another treatement from John when I am back in Singapore. Highly recommend this place.\n\n",
        "Kim Welter\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy husband and I are from Luxembourg and we go annually to Singapore for family visits.  One of the \"must\" for both of us is to go to John Woo for body/ foot massages.  During our visit to Singapore, we shall try to go as often as possible to benefit from the massages.  John Woo is really very professional in his massages, he knows which reflex points to massage to get the best results.  He also know the level of strength to use during the massages : to bring out the best satisfaction without causing too much pain.  Itis highly recommendable for everyone, whether as locals or as tourist visitors, to get his massages, as a form of relaxation for the whole body or foot.  Wished we have someone like him here in our country!\n\n",
        "Areti Alexandrou\nLocal Guide\u00b7212 reviews\u00b7300 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAmazingly effective and relaxing massage. Excellent service and feel like brand new again after the session. They understand injury, pain management and gave excellent advice. Don\u2019t go anywhere else, just come here and enjoy Singaporean massage!\n\n",
        "Penny Green\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWhilst on holiday we found this gem of a place and returned three days in a row to have foot massages.  It was fantastic, lovely atmosphere, great foot bath followed by amazing massage.  John is professional and very knowledgeable about what he does, we highly recommend anyone to visit.  The only disappointment is that we didn't find this place at the beginning of our holiday, so we could enjoy everyday after lots of walking.  Thank you John.  See you next time we are in Singapore.\n\n",
        "Ng Siew Seng Peter\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nJia Kang was introduce by a friend due to my suffering of nerve pains on my left leg. Met John there, he was helpful and kind to attend to my problem. After a few weeks felt much better and strongly recommend to others like me with this problem!! Soothing and great environment!!!

        "Rachel Toh\nLocal Guide\u00b77 reviews\u00b737 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThank you for the great massage!! I could feel that the masseuse knew what he was doing as he really pressed the right acupunctural spots so relieve the tension I was holding in my body.

        "Minette Norman\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAfter a 16-hour flight from San Francisco to Singapore, I had the pleasure of an hour foot reflexology massage by John Woo. He has an amazing ability to know every spot that needs attention and asked several times if it was too much pressure. I left feeling both energized and relaxed and slept like a baby that night. I wish he worked in SF so I could have a weekly treatment!\n\n",
        "Alex Ho\nLocal Guide\u00b772 reviews\u00b770 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDecided to do foot reflex since I have some spare time before my dinner appointment at Clarke Quay. The place is really nice, and I started my session with a nice aromatic foot bath, then foot reflex and back massage! Will definitely come back for massage in future! Thanks!\n\n",

The master is not sloppy and clicks every place carefully. The pressing is in place. It is comfortable and easy to press.
