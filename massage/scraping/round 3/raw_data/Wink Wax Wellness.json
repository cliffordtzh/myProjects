Overall, it was clean and I'm really impressed on the service she has done! Highly recommend her if you guys would like to book under her. Definitely would come again for my next appointment!\n\n",
        "Kenzi H\n7 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI was seen to by Ann and she did an great job! She was very friendly and bubbly, service was great, I actually thought it was done better than some better known places I have been to (won't say the name but they're in orchard area haha) Price was fantastic as a first time customer. Even the alacart price was better than other places by about $30. I was initially a lil scared that the service wouldn't be good as it's cheap and in a very small unit at tanjong pagar, but I'm very happy I chose to come here.\n\nActually even when I called in, the person on the phone when I initially booked my appt was very very friendly and jovial, not sure if it was Ann but either way, I was very pleased with the service and Def will be back. Thanks Ann!!\n\n",

Her reassuring attitude and services definitely made me feel comfortable and calm throughout the session.  The staff are polite and professional. Not at all pressurizing as there are no hard-selling.

        "Miriam Deliva\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWhen I think Waxing in Singapore? I think of Ann!\n\nAnn is an incredibly attentive and thoughtful beauty therapist! I'm a big fan of hers for many reasons. I've been going to salons for waxing for many many years. But coming to Asia I found that some waxing therapists do a rushed job and they are not quality therapists. I've been in Singapore for 2 years now and have only been going to her.\n\nAnn has a unique way of making you feel comfortable. She is considerate and she is very funny. I think it's important to not only have great customer service but genuinely show you care for your customers. I recommend her to my work colleagues and other friends when they are looking for wax and beauty therapists. She's become a part of my 'Go To Ladies' for beauty. I won't recommend anyone else to my network! Ann is knowledgeable, experienced and simply the best!\n\n",

        "Doris DS\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI like to compliment Ann for being such a great service provider. She makes the whole waxing process an ease and a pleasant experience. Highly professional and skilful, she is also relational and genuinely cares for her client. She assessed my pain threshold, knows I am terrified of laser but is able to reassure me during the laser process. I have been to other waxing salons and laser services and I think Ann provides the best so far. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to do waxing or laser. Great job Ann!\n\n",

        "Joy Poh\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI first met Ann 2 years ago when I signed up for a trial session of Brazilian waxing and I am a loyal customer since then. Ann is professional, outgoing, fun and makes one feels comfortable during the session. I was feeling so nervous (and shy) as this is the first time I'm doing Brazilian waxing but Ann showed her professionalism by letting me know what she was doing the entire session while trying to calm me down by talking to me the whole time. Ann is not pushy and understands what I need before recommending the package or session that is most suitable and money-worthy for me. I would strongly recommend Ann to anyone who wants to try any of their services. (In fact I did and now, she's also another loyal customer of Ann\ud83d\ude0a)\nService: Laser hair removal\n\n",
        "Rachel Ong\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have been going to Wink Wax for almost 10 years now (can't remember when i actually starting visiting them). It started with waxing treatment and now i am doing my laser hair removal with them. The therapists are all very friendly and my favourite is Lyan. She is very professional and always makes me feel relaxed. I enjoy my chats with her during my treatment. She is honest, reliable and non-pushy at all. Gives good advice on your condition before recommending any treatment - nothing unnecessary. The treatments have been very effective however I don't go as often as before as currently the treatments I do are just for maintenance purpose. Also i think it is great to show some support to small local business like them in difficult time like this.\nService: Laser hair removal\n\n",
        "Amber Lieu\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have been doing my waxing with Ann for more than a year now. This is my second time purchasing their waxing package! I\u2019ve tried waxing at several different places and I always prefer wink because my sessions are so fast, comfortable and as painless as it can get. Ann is extremely professional and we always have a nice chat so I can distract myself from the pain \ud83d\ude02  As a broke student, I appreciate that there is no hard selling involved and I never feel pressured to purchase more than what I want. Booking appointments are extremely fuss free too. I can foresee that I will be a regular customer.\n\n",
        "Jesse Quek\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAs a regular customer for the past 5 years, I see Wink Wax as a very professional set-up, and they ensure that their respective outlets maintain a high level of professionalism, cleanliness and service. Their branding in the market is a sweet spot between great quality and value / price. I personally don't feel like I'm overpaying for their service.\n\nWhat is the most important for me as a customer is that they do not practice any \"hard-selling\" techniques to get me to purchase additional packages / services. The way they manage their sales is very organic and client-centric, which essentially means that you are not being constantly hustled into buying something. This lays the base for a very relaxed and worry-free environment to walk into.\n\nYou will also find that the specialists at Wink Wax come from an experienced background of waxing services. One such specialist is Ann Tan, who embodies the company's values and what they do best in - professionalism, quality services, cleanliness and punctuality. She is also a great conversationalist which helps to ease any awkwardness. It is very evident that Ann takes pride is what she does, and puts her clients' needs first. She is also very knowledgable in this line of business, given her many years of experience. She is my go-to specialist.\n\nIt is not hard to see why Wink Wax is highly successful in this industry, and why they have a huge client base. I'd highly recommend (10/10) those who are in the market for great quality-value waxing services.\nService: Laser hair removal\n\n",
        "Sheryl Tan\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe place makes you feel instantly welcomed. Your beautician/therapist is a value-add to your life, on a personal level. (Don\u2019t get me wrong, they don\u2019t probe they provide you with a good listening ear and they make even me wanna share). I don\u2019t speak highly of many things in life but I am sure, if anyone wants good waxing/hair removal or any beauty services done, this Is a place that should never be missed. My therapist Ann is the third waxing therapist I\u2019ve had, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s gonna be my last for as long as I\u2019m in Singapore.\n\n",

        "Valerie K\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAnn is very professional, friendly and honest. Her genuine sincerity towards her customers is what makes each session enjoyable. Understanding her customers well is what makes Ann great at her job as she remembers their preferences even if it has been quite a long time since she has seen them. She also does not push her customers towards loyalty but instead allows them the freedom to explore their options. =)\nService: Laser hair removal\n\n",

I am very much pleased with Ann's services thus far. Ann gives very detailed recommendations, explaining the benefits and the duration needed to be able to see results. She clearly breaks down the costs and payment schemes for my consideration. Ann is very thorough during sessions, ensuring customer's satisfaction with her services. Over the years, Ann is not only my therapist, she has also become a good friend whom I look forward to meeting on a bi-monthly or monthly basis.

        "Charlene Munday\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWink Wax is my preferred choice for waxing! I was referred by a friend for a trial after many sub-par waxing experiences in Singapore. My therapist, Ann, is very friendly and funny and always go the extra mile to make every session as comfortable for me as possible. One thing I really like about Wink Wax and what really sets them apart is that they do not push you to sign up for thousands of dollars worth of packages - they have a very reasonable package deal and they don't hard sell or get you to add on services which is why I keep coming back!\n\nThanks Ann & team!\n\n",
        "Ferisha Abbas\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have been going to Wink Wax for their Brazilian waxing and IPL services for over ten months. The package may seem pricey at first but trust me, it is money well spent. As a first timer, I felt that getting a Brazilian done to be a very intimate and intimidating process \u2013 having to \u2018expose\u2019 yourself to a complete stranger. However, I am very fortunate to have Ann as my therapist. Her warm, bubbly and reassuring personality made my first-time experience a very smooth and comfortable one. Ann is also quick and efficient \u2013 qualities you need in a therapist to ensure that the process is as painless as possible! Needless to say, my experience for subsequent sessions were as positive as my first. I appreciate that Ann goes above and beyond her job by building rapport with her customers (I can\u2019t imagine anyone else doing IPL for me!) and not \u2018hard-selling\u2019 packages. In all, I highly recommend Ann from Wink Wax as she delivers both quality service and product. She has made me a very happy and hairless (at the right places) individual!

They are one of the few that provide full waxing and optical hair removal service for male client in Singapore, which include Brazilian waxing.

Their service has been top notch, clean, professional and most importantly I\u2019m very comfortable as they do not do hard selling like other salons. They are very caring in catering towards your pain tolerance level, they will adjust their methods accordingly to their customers and always asks if this is ok, that is ok, if the wax temperature is fine. They will ask what is your concern on your treated areas and suggests a treatment that suits you. They will also be patient to explain why, which adds on to their great customer service! Highly recommend!\n\n",

Last week, I was very disappointed to find out that Mike is leaving after 7 years and I quickly got an appointment to have my last waxing session done by him. I really hope he comes back again or as a part timer because he is the only one I trusted to do waxing for me as he was the only male and there was a rapport built. Now I'm not sure on how to move on with Winkwax because I still have $400+ credits left and the only reason I took it up was because of Mike. And now with Mike gone, I hope Winkwax comes up with an alternative solution for customers affected by Mike's departure.\n\n",
