Communicated with me where I feel pain and applied pressure at the right spot.\n\nReceptionist friendly and I really like how this place is fuss-free and no persuasion to sign on any package at all.\n\nSuch a pleasant experience.\n\nWill be back!\n\n",
        "Ku Mo\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI asked for back massage but the male massager called Brian said my shoulder stiff and only massage neck and shoulder. No hand, arm and he tapped back few times only. I have a problem with my back so I wanted back massage.  I wanted to complain but because there is next appointment no time.\n\n",

        "Jess Ong\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad been having a stiff neck for a few days and went for an upper back + foot reflexology combo. Qingyun was my masseuse . I felt so much better and found myself naturally sitting up straight after his massage. I like very strong massages and he definately has the strength. He was also very caring and gave tips/reminders on my posture. Thumbs up.\n\n",
        "Taufiq Zailani\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nJust ended my 1 hour body massage. All the way that masseuse was using his elboy and there is no oil at all. I thought there is cos usually they will use right? All the way massage my body but there is no massage on the legs or at all. Wasted my 58$ for a 1 hour session. Will definitely not recommend this to other people in the future. Sorry\n\n",
        "Alicia Cheng\n14 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAcrually I recommend Qingyun to my friend based on Google review but I have yet to try.  Tried his services yesterday and had a good sleep.  Had bad headache and somehow it was gone by after foot reflexology.  Hmm will go out again for his services.\n\n",
        "Xue Ping Yeo\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy first visit to this outlet and I love the environment and very relaxing. I would highly recommend this outlet and my masseur is Qing Yun from China and he is very friendly and professional in his skills and services. One of the best foot masseur I've tried. I will definitely back again. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a\n\n",
        "Danish Matin\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nPoor service. I pay for 1 hour for a full oil massage and not even a single oil was being used during the session. Massage should be using hand and this guy from the start until the session ended, he using elbow to press on my body until my body feel so painful after the massage.\n\n",
        "Izwandy Anwar\nLocal Guide\u00b75 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI called their number to book an hour long appointment at 1145am.\n\nI reached at 1140am, and was caught by surprise when the counter lady told me that my massage will only start at 12pm as she saw a mistake in the booking timings. I told her that I could not take an hour starting from 12pm as my son finishes his playgroup session at 1245pm. I think it's only a professional courtesy to notify me in advance on her mistake, not when I've already arrived at their door step and after making payment.\n\nThe franchise's only saving grace: She did offer me to take up 40 minute massage instead of an hour and gave me back a refund.\n\n",
        "Jaya Kumar\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad enjoy a relaxing 60 mins body massage by Lisa and 60 mins foot massage by Raveen.\nGood amount of strength, Great skills and nice environment. Towels are change after the massage it\u2019s good to do that during this covid. Thumbs up.\n\n",
        "Angelyn Tan\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGood foot massage by Qingyun and David. On point when massaging my foot and back. My partner and me will continue to have our weekly massage by Qingyun.\n\n",
        "Sara Bedazzled\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nHad a bad massage done by Ann. Supposed to be a full body massage but she did my back only didn't cover my front and when asked she said she wasn't aware. Full body suppose to be full body and not just the back. Her massage was poorly done too till I asked her to use strength. Sorry basically a lifeless chicken doing massage. I didn't want to say anything I just paid the full price which wasn't even worth it. I have done massage here with other masuese without any complaints.\n\n",

        "quennie low\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis was my first time getting foot reflexology. Frankly, it was quite painful. I never expected the foot massage this way. But the therapist told me i will feel netter\nAfter completing the massage, my feet were feeling very light and numb.\nAs it was my first time, i can't compare it or  call it good or bad.\nThe ambience was good, the staff was friendly.\n\n",

        "Chernice Goh\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDespite booking an appointment an hour before the massage they managed to gave me a slot . The person who was helping me to do the massage was also really awesome cant remember her name but she was the one who helped me with a body massage and she was so considerate throughout the massage session and she made sure she got all the spots where I was feeling really sore and she even asked if I was cold and I said yes , she went on to get another blanket/ towel to cover my body  . Would go back again \ud83d\ude0d ( for the same lady )\n\n",

        "Peighton Velo\n10 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWas told on the phone and via whatsapp they\u2019ll do prenatal massages even at 9 months pregnant. Than when trying to book they said no due to fear of complications. Sorry, but you guys are not doctors and I wouldn\u2019t be trying to book a massage if my doctor wasn\u2019t okay with it. Shouldn\u2019t tell customers yes and then change minds.\n\n",

Clean and quiet.\n\nA friend recommended Rose and I was so glad that I had her as my masseur. just finished an hour foot and 40 mins body. The pressure was on point.

        "cho Joey\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\n(Translated by Google) I personally like the staff service of this massage shop. I also recommend the man named qing yun. He explained my problems when he massaged my feet and pressed my sore acupoints forcefully without taking my time. , I don\u2019t like some massage parlors who take my time and help me press freely. I am very satisfied with the staff here. He is very dedicated to help me massage my feet. I am very grateful to qing yun for helping me solve my problem, and I will ask my friends to request his service next time.
