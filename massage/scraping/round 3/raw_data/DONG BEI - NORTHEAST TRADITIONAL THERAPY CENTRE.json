        "Johnny Ho\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI was recommended by my close friend to try this shop massage. I went down with another friend recently. Need to book appointment 1st b4 going down as they are quite fully booked. There are a total of 5 masseur, 4 female n 1 male. Aw we had a hr  body massage n it was good. Although it's a bit painful for me, especially the calves, the next day, I felt better n my aches n tightness at my neck area are gone. Totally worth the $$ n will be planning going back fortnightly.\n\n",
        "Dol Chew\nLocal Guide\u00b7117 reviews\u00b71,660 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nA small establishment with 4 foot reflexology seats. Found the staff to be rather rude during my visit with friends. We were asked to push the foot rest out for our feet wash and the drying towels were thrown to us. Not knowing what to do with the towels, I left the towels on the seat and was told off by one of the staff. Assuming if we are supposed to lay our own towels, shouldn't we be informed in a better way?\n\nNo assistance was offered to my girlfriend, who has trouble reaching the foot rest to dry her feet after her foot wash. They were nonchalant to see her struggling.\n\nThis is the place to go if you aren't bothered by service.\n\n$16 for 30mins foot reflexology. Do note this is for appointment before 8pm, otherwise it is $20 for 30mins.\n\nOnly cash payment available.\n\n",
        "Shohini Sengupta\nLocal Guide\u00b724 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nA no-frills, no-nonsense, 100% value place. This is where I've had the best foot massage in Singapore. I fall asleep every time, it is that relaxing!\nThe body massage is also great. The pressure is more on the firmer side, but I always find all aches and pains gone afterwards.\nThe best part is the consistent excellent service no matter who your therapist is. There is one Aunty in particular (unfortunately I don't know her name), who works magic and makes your pain disappear.\nThe only thing I'd say is that sometimes it is a bit hard to communicate, because everyone does not have the same proficiency in English. But it doesn't matter really as the staff always find a way to get their meaning across regardless. :) I'm a happy repeat customer for the last 3 years.\n\n",

        "Fiona Rae\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nPrice is decent for a proper traditional massage! They know what what their doing and will tackle all your problem areas. If you\u2019re looking for a pretty spa type of place, this isn\u2019t for you. But if you need to a no-frills deep massage, this is exactly what Dong Bei is about.\n\n",
