        "Kenneth W\nLocal Guide\u00b790 reviews\u00b761 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nBeen there a few times. Can be painful as it's really deep tissue massage as the shop name says. My arm pain did improve but didn't really help my wife's frozen shoulder. She went X-ray and found other issues. So in summary it may or may not help. Depends on the issue. Service wise, they are friendly but can chat too much among themselves. But they won't slow down even you are in pain. Guess it's part of their training to keep working on the issue to unblock the blockage and improve flow. So also depends on your pain tolerance. Not for everyone.\n\n",
        "Elena Yeo\n2 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nHeard about this massage place and read all the good reviews so gave it a try thinking that I have a high pain tolerance. The 1hr massage was excruciating and I had tears in my eyes! xD they really know how to rub out your pain and problem points. My husband went as well and he enjoyed it. However, a few hours after the massage, the muscles that were massaged over began to feel very sore and swollen, and it was so painful that it was difficult to get up this morning. The problem areas that were rubbed are also bruised and swollen now, not sure if this is a natural outcome from these deep tissue treatments??am hesitant to go back again.\n\n",
        "Maximilian Jackson\nLocal Guide\u00b748 reviews\u00b728 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nXiao Xi deep tissue massage works miracles. They really know their stuff. Everyone you get is well trained and is able to work on the deep tissue. Highly recommended.\n\n",

        "Hye\nLocal Guide\u00b732 reviews\u00b710 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nThe tuina here is super painful but helpful. Usually they only focus on 1or 2 parts. Means u need a 2hrs session to get your full body tuina. I'm fine with space as long as they do change the sheet every time.\n\n",
        "Cheow Mong Chan\nLocal Guide\u00b7125 reviews\u00b7119 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent for tuina session. 1.5 hrs extend to 2 hrs.\nMy masseuse was Ah Kun. She was very skillful in massaging blocked acupuncture points that I didn't even know was blocked (super painful i almost cried out). If you don't have a high pain threshold, ask the masseuse to go softer. Other customers there were crying in pain.\n\nCall beforehand cause quite a lot of bookings and customers. Haven't tried the foot massage but nobody crying for help there.\n\nAs many mentioned, place was cramp, no frills, not for fussies. Go in, massage and get out.\n\nMy wife loved it and immediately booked another session next week. We paid $100 per pax for 2 hrs tuina.\n\n",
        "Henry Choo\nLocal Guide\u00b79 reviews\u00b719 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nTaking the advice from earlier reviews, went down after making a  morning appointment for shoulder pains I've been enduring for several weeks. The place was already quite packed at 10am and there was intermittent chatter amongst the therapists during the session (which I was mentally prepared for). Most importantly, the therapist seems well versed in understanding the cause of my shoulder pain and also recommended exercises for me to help with recovery (in Mandarin). The massage was uncomfortable to the point of almost being excruciating, but my shoulder dexterity and pain improved significantly after the treatment. The only reason for docking 1 star is because the place felt a little cramped.\n\nI'd recommend this place especially if you are seeking treatment for specific muscle injuries, but be prepared to endure discomfort.\n\n",
        "Nicole Liz\nLocal Guide\u00b765 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nXiao Xi is a very experienced therapist who\u2019s knows how to treat injuries as well as common pain. The environment may not be relaxing as they speak to each other through the curtains, but her skills are definitely worth going for.\n\nUpdate: gave 5 stars at first but bumping it down because now that she gets more customers she doesn\u2019t take appointments seriously and doesn\u2019t put in the effort to massage properly. Went there on a Saturday and she just rushed through and was very rough.\n\n",
        "Daren\nLocal Guide\u00b725 reviews\u00b714 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nThey really know your pain points. The first time I went there, it was horrible experience. Do not go near their closing time. The lady felt a little distracted and felt like she just wanted to get the job done and go home.\n\nI did give it a second try in the early afternoon and it was a rather pleasant experience. I had a stiff neck and a strained shoulder. The lady did a good job in kneading that knot at the back of the neck.\n\nGo for mid day sessions.\n\n",
        "Eve Lim\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\u00b734 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThey are well-known in bukit timah area. Been going to their place for many years.\nHappy with them.\n\n",
        "Vanessa Lee\n16 reviews\u00b710 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nXiaoxi's staff are always very good with pinpointing the troubled spots in my body and yes of course, no pain no gain. But after that your body loosens up. Swing by here to pamper yourself, but remember to call to book appointment as here is always packed. Take note: now with SMM, only one foot reflexology session per slot.\n\n",
        "Enaeji\u3048\u306a\u3048\u3058\nLocal Guide\u00b724 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThey really know the spot that I needed. Thank you. I will come again next time.\n\n",
        "Jonathan Chan\n1 review\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nGood massage but extremely very poor management skills.\n\nMasseur will squeeze in every appointments possible. I had to wait 30mins even when appointment was made.\n\nMasseurs also double-up as the receptionist so you get alot of shouting across the 'rooms'\n\n",
        "Ang Vicki\nLocal Guide\u00b780 reviews\u00b772 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nCheap price comes with non-pro skills.  The stroke on my left leg was entire different from the right leg. Location where I told her to soften up, she will add strength till I need to withdraw my leg from her. Throughout the period, she was only interested to grap her next customers and add up as a receptionist. There is no massage, only touch here and there. Try Kenko, then you can tell different.  Kenko is like the therapist are well versed & educated on where to press & message ( till you can fall asleep). Xiao xi therapist is like very make shift, as long I touch your legs, it is considered as massage. Most of the therapist's time are trying to fill their slots as much as possible, earning the quickest way with the least effort. I won't waste my money on this place any more. Complete waste of time.\n\n",
        "Aria Mangunkusumo\n2 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\ngreat massage technique. but it was very chaotic: noisy and crammed. Masseur were kept talking with each other during sessions and although the place was crammed, they speak in high volume (read: noisy).\n\n",
        "Wei Wei\n3 reviews\u00b78 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSpot on Tuina therapy if you are in need of hardcore deep tissue massage!\n\n",
        "ruben S.R\n6 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThe guy was playing piano with my leg. So pathetic massage. As if he was forced to do it. Terrible service. Don't recommend if you are looking for a proper foot massage.\n\n",
        "Zynthia Lim\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nXiaoxi is a very experienced therapist.  I have this pain for more than 4 months and none of the therapists that I have gone to was able to help me until someone recommended me to Xiao Xi.  She knew where my pain was and after one treatment I felt better.  Good job!\n\n",
        "Christine Quah\nLocal Guide\u00b7125 reviews\u00b710 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nAh Mei is a lazy therapist with a very poor attitude. Her massage technique was terrible and refused to adjust the pressure even when I repeatedly asked. She ended up shouting at me when I gave feedback to the boss after the message. I paid full price for a horrible massage that did nothing for me.\n\n",
        "Brian Tiong\n6 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nRecommended by a friend, Good sports massage relived a back pain that was nagging for months. Looks like most people come for sports related injuries.\n\n",
