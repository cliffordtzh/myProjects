Arrived early but had to wait for my appointment timing. Was greeted by the front-desk manager. Place is cosy, clean and very private. Small little cosy front shop that opens up to many rooms inside. My therapist Chloe was very friendly,  very polite and had very soothing hands. All in all a very relaxing massage.\n\n",

        "Ash Mohd\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHi. Firstly, The place really lives up to its name. I would like compliment one of the therapist. I had a Hot Oil Massage session with Isha on New Year's Day at 8pm. All i can say is she is great at what she is doing. She can sense that my body was super tense and she just knew how much pressure to apply and what technique to use. She even managed to resolve the problem i had with my right shoulder. I would definitely come back for more sessions at Fave Spa.\n\n",

        "Sid A\n1 review\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\n16 July 2020\nRevisited Fave spa had a Vietnamese therapist, was an very displeasing experience this time. The masseuse was in her own zone, kept working my back again and again the same spots for 50+ mins low skills. When it came to legs seemed to try rush by did not care much on taking feedback.. 0 communication and absolutely was an opposite to the experience prior with Cherrie. Due to the lack of consistency and a bad massage on a day when I needed it the most. Changing my review to 2 stars.\n\nJune 2020\nHad a massage yesterday from Cherry around 5.30 pm. She was excellent in providing a massage as well as to small talk making the whole experience comfortable & relaxing. Fave center was very diligent with the cleanliness standards considering the CV19 situation so thank you for that and keep up the great work :)\n\n",

        "joe tai\n1 review\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nBad receptionist.  I called at 2 to make appointment at 3 today.  Got to the place at 3 and the receptionist said she didn't have me down for an appointment and nothing is available.   So I start question on who took the call and I showed them that I called and ask for a solution.. instead all she said is with an attitude that I already told you I'm sorry but there is nothing she can do.. the next slot is at 4:30 ... First of all, it's not my problem that you made a mistake of not writing down called in appointment requests and taking other customer.  And second instead of offering ways to make up the time I took to get over there.  All the reception did was said  well I already told you I'm sorry what else you want me to do.    I've had massage there before and is good but the receptionist attitude is extremely bad...    A good way of doing business would prob be saying that  let me book your appointment for 4:30 and take 10 15% off or something..  nothing.. simply said nothing right now  and nothing she can do..    you just lost a customer...\n______________________________________________\nUpdate:\nThe management reached out and provided the explaintion and resolution within couple hours.\nGood job on that.\n\n",

She said ok n took down details. Made appointment for 17th today at 9am.  When he went at 9am a different girl at the reception Said they do only for sporeans.  What Rubbish!!!!!\nMy son in law came back n told me.  I tot it was some miscommunication.  I than went to Fave Spa and spoke to the china girl who told me the same thing in broken English which I managed to grasp.\nYou should educate your staff on terms and conditions.  They seem to have their own rules and regulations.\nI also asked them where is your boss. And they all said 'dont know never come to shop. So never see\"\n\nStrange.\n-------------------------------------\n\nI tried calling the number but the girl said owner not in.  She put me to the manager who couldn't speak English. So I left my contact wth the reception.\n\nAnyway is it true that Fave Spa is for sporeans Only.\n\n",
