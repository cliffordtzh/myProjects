        "Fu SH\nLocal Guide\u00b726 reviews\u00b751 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGlad to find this fantastic massage shop on the heartlands. Went twice and both times the masseuse was very professional in helping to resolve some of the back issues I had.\n\nIt was not a relaxation session but more of a healing session to loosen knots. Office workers: Highly recommend this place to look after your physical wellbeing!\n\n",

        "Shin\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI went for 3 massages at different places this week, and this place was the one that did it for me.  My therapist was xiao hui, and she did an excellent job, releasing every knots and soreness meticulously, although it was painful as expected from Chinese tui na. For the price they charge, please don't expect a fancy interior, but the bed was clean, all their masseuse are very familiar and chatty with clients, and you can be rest assured it is worth every penny. Will be back!\n\n",
