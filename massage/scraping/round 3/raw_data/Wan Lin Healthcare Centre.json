        "Leon T.\n7 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAuthentic and professional massage.\nThe masseur was really skillful and able to effectively relieve the tensions in my muscles, especially the tension knots around my neck and shoulders. Also, the environment was really clean and gives off a really relaxing and comfortable vibe.\n\nOverall, a truly enjoyable massage experience. Highly recommend!\n\n",
        "Sihui Loke\n2 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAwesome massage experience at WanLin. I wear heels and go to the gym often and was experiencing aching on my soles. I also have stiff neck as a result of poor ergonomics during WFH.\n\nThe masseuse really eased the knots in my body. Appreciated the fact that the place was really easy to locate and environment is relaxing with lots of antiques as well.\n\nPlus point is that I can charge my phone there while I enjoy the foot massage.\n\nHighly recommended :) !\n\n",
        "Hui Ming Chiak\n3 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had a lot of muscle knots and stiffness in my back and shoulders which the masseuse was able to rub them out. Been to quite a few massage places before but many of them weren\u2019t able to fully rub them out for me. For once, I didn\u2019t even have to ask the masseuse to use strength and he was able to rub them out properly with the right amount of strength. He was able to isolate and pin point my affected areas without even telling him about it. Sadly, I didn't get his name as I had to rush off. Overall, I wasn't expecting anything but I think I\u2019ve found my new go-to massage place now :) The service was great and the masseuse kept asking me if the strength was okay. 10/10 recommend\n\n",

        "Phyll Y.\nLocal Guide\u00b7354 reviews\u00b754 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nWe did 40-min foot reflexology and 20-min shoulder + back massage with 2 female masseuses and it was amazing, relieving us of our feet, neck and shoulder aches. The environment is clean and comfortable too and I foresee returning for regular sessions. That said, my friend and I realised that our masseuses both appeared exhausted working through the evening, and one mentioned they didn't have time to go for proper meals that day. As much as I like the ease of having multiple time slots to book online, it'd be nice to see well-rested masseuses with sufficient break and meal times. Perhaps the management could look into improving the welfare of their masseuses. Happy workers, happy vibes for customers too.\n\n",
        "Alvin L (JustBringIt)\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTook a 60min full body massage and was assigned a masseur. Masseur was knowledgeable, hands were strong, technique was good as well. Masseur focused more on my neck as I have a very stiff neck and shoulder. Will be back next time to focus on my lower back. Highly recommended!\n\n",
        "Jasmine Wong\n16 reviews\u00b715 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery good masseur can be found here, had a 1 hour body massage with Lin. She is so good and experience, and helped to relieve for all the tension i believe i had in my muscles or whole body. She can literally pinpoint the areas that need more attention in after i mentioned the pains i had during massage. Had a very good sleep thereafter. Highly recommended. Thank you Lin =)\n\n",
        "Charlene Koh\nLocal Guide\u00b712 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy go-to massage place. My mom is a regular here and was the one who introduced me to this joint after some of my bad experiences at some other local massage chains. I go to school nearby and came here one day after a horrible 4-hour headache that left me in agony throughout my entire lecture-filled day. A quick 1-hour session with a request for the auntie who did my massage to focus on my tense back and neck did MAGIC. I swear.\n\nI come here now with my bf who is a chef and on his feet all day, and he feels rejuvenated after a quick hour rubdown. I'd honestly give more stars if I could. Reasonable prices and skilled therapists and super convenient location as well.\n\n",
        "Mandi Cheung\nLocal Guide\u00b711 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOverall, I had a seamless experience! I also found the pricing to be very reasonable, shop was easy to locate as well.\n\nFirstly, I was received by the staff with a warm welcome! The environment was clean and comfortable. I had a 40min foot massage + 20min shoulder massage - my masseuse (Esther) was warm, skilled and adjusted pressure to my preference.\n\nThere\u2019s just one part I felt could be improved, I had to walk on the mall\u2019s floor barefoot after taking off my shoes, into the shop. Maybe some carpets/slippers could be placed at the entrance to enhance this experience. That would make everything perfect!\n\n",
        "Michelle Ho\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDid a 40mins foot + 20mins shoulder massage today and its awesome!! I usually dont do foot massage as my pain tolerance is not that high. The masseur adjusted his pressure to my comfort and i even fell asleep! Will definitely come back again, thanks!\n\n",

        "Ruth Chong\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWent for full body massage, told the masseuse I had neck and back injury before hence the muscles there were stiff. And told her to apply light pressure to these areas.\n\nAll went well with my back. She applied light pressure and loosened out the knots just fine.\n\nBut for my neck, she went crazy. The first thing she did was take one finger and jab it very hard into the back of my neck (the area between neck and head). The pain was intense. It radiated to the back of my eye and side of my head. The whole night, my neck, head and eye, were aching. Today is the 2nd day, and these areas are still painful. I hope she did not do lasting damage to any nerves.\n\nWhile she probably meant well, I think she needs to pay better attention to her customers needs. And learn how to massage properly instead of just jabbing really hard.\n\n",
        "Nicole Alano\n1 review\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy first time going for this kind of massage and it was really amazing.\nZi Co massaged me and I experienced the foot and shoulder massage which lasted for 1 hour.\nI have back pain and when I mentioned it to him, he was able to help me out and ease my muscle tension.\nI also saw there are a lot of foreign customers that came and they mentioned that they are regulars here when they come to Singapore.\n\nReally relaxing. Thank you!\n\n",
        "Wei Teck\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a very pleasant experience over at Wan Lin. Masseuse was very friendly and good at his craft. The environment is very relaxing as well. You can change into their clothes so don\u2019t worry about wearing long sleeve and jeans. Definitely will recommend if you\u2019re looking for a good local massage place.\n\n",
        "Shanice (shaniceaneo)\n7 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBooked in advance and did a 40 min foot massage and 20 min shoulder massage. The location was convenient and in town. I like how it is efficient, no waiting time and staffs are friendly. The masseuse asked me for my preference of the degree of pressure for the massage. Love it and will definitely recommend to my friends!\n\n",
        "bimbu chen\n4 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent there for a session on the 03 June 2019 at 1945hrs. Booking through the website was seamless and the massage store is clean and professional. I went for the package which consist of 40 minutes foot massage and 20 minutes shoulder massage. Jenny was my masseuse and she was very experienced and skilful with the blood circulation points (\u8840\u9053) which provided me with a very relaxing experience. Before the session, my leg felt extremely tensed and heavy but after the session, it felt more relaxed and \u201clight\u201d. Amazing experience here and the only thing that i regretted for the session is not opting for a longer session!\n\nThank you Wan Lin for the wonderful experience!\n\nCheers,\nShixin :)\n\n",
        "Jordan Chong\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had a 60-minute full body massage done by Tina. Her technique was really good, she pressed at all the right points and with just the right amount of strength. All my aches just disappeared afterwards. Honestly, it was better than most of the massages I have gotten in Thailand, especially in terms of technique. The ambiance was relaxing and the price is very affordable too! Would definitely go back for more. Tip for others is to book a slot on their website early because the place is usually quite packed.\n\n",
        "Choo Zhe Jun\n1 review\u00b78 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWan Lin has the best masseurs and masseuses in Singapore. I had a pleasant half-body massage session, where the masseuse knew where my hardened knots and pains are, and automatically massaged these parts more. She even explained the causes, and recommended some of the poor habits that resulted in body aches. I suggest this healthcare centre to everyone needing a massage, as my whole body relieved after my session!\n\n",
        "Jermane Tan\n4 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent there for a session on the 03 June 2019 at 1945hrs with my boyfriend after a long day at work where my body and legs are sore.\n\nI went for the package which consist of 40 minutes foot massage and 20 minutes shoulder massage together with my boyfriend and June was assigned to me. June was extremely patient and experienced while providing me with the massage and i appreciate her effort for constantly checking with me if the pressure applied was fine. The entire session was extremely soothing and relaxing and June was extremely great with the pressure points with my foot and shoulders. After the session, all the soreness was gone and i felt extremely relieved. The shop in general is very clean and well-equipped with entertainment facilities such as TVs and hot towels to clean your feet. I definitely will recommend you guys to come try it out after a long day of shopping at Bugis Street!\n\nThank you Wan Lin for the wonderful experience!\n\nWith love,\nJermane\n\n",
        "Jacky Poea\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\u00b774 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had really bad muscle aches on my legs. Tried to search for foot massage around the vicinity and saw quite a number of good review. Decided to try and I was really amazed by the masseur's massage skill. Kenny really knows what he is doing and my legs feel so much better. 38 dollars for 60 mins. Reasonable price. Will definitely come back again when I need another fix for my legs. :)\n\n",
        "ABISHEK SURESH\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nEverything was excellent! The staff were very welcoming; the beds were soft; the masseuse (Jenny) was strong and pressed at all the right pressure points and even the payment was convenient since they accept paynow. It was a much needed massage after a stressful week at work. It really helped me to de-stress and relax my muscles. I got the full body massage for 60 minutes and it was surprisingly very affordable. I would highly recommend making a booking early especially if you have a particular masseuse in mind. It was very convenient to do the booking on my phone and I could even choose the masseuse I wanted. Jenny\u2019s schedule can be quite packed so I suggest booking early.\n\n",
        "Tony Ma\n18 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBest massage in the city & I\u2019ve tried many places here. Therapists actually understand what they\u2019re doing and put in significant effort during the session. Love it\n\n",
        "Jolyn Chua\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nCame for a massage and booked online in advance with Max at 3pm for foot & shoulder massage.\n\nPlace is popular, constantly packed with customers and sat around for 10 minutes and only got in at 3:10pm.\n\nThe counter and massuers here all seem busy rushing with back to back schedules and were moving around for toilet breaks / short bites or preparing the place for massage.\n\nMassage was quite a painful experience, but definitely a therapeutic one. The Massuer put in efforts in massaging and is hardworking.\n\nPlace is well kept and furnished, with fresh towels.\n\nFor this price range in Singapore, it is a good place with great standards.\nHighly recommended! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n",

        "Yi Ting Koh\n6 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVisited this place due to the good Google reviews. Made a reservation and had Jenny for my full body massage and she was really impressive ! She knew exactly where are the spots that requires more attention. Kenny is really great too as bf was impressed with his strength and skills. Did have some communication blunder when me and my bf came for our booking, was assign to foot massage at first which confuses us. However, the issue was resolved after double checking with the Staffs. Improvement can be made to communications at the reception side  where customers can be provided with clearer instructions and asked for their reservation/preference of massage. Overall, the experience is great. No doubt would visit them again!\n\n",

        "Osh Kosh2\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\n1st time here, came because of the high review rating. Total disappointment, wasted time and money. did 90 minutes foot massage. assigned an old uncle who is just wasting time touching and rubbing my skin with lotion, hardly using any bit of strength, wondering if he could even afford more strength to begin with. I didn't request for no oldie/younger upfront because i didn't expect they will assign such an old uncle who barely has any strength, will be very rude to reject when he is in front of me. repeated request for more strength also make me feel bad. i suggest you have to make request upfront no old uncle. if you are fine to be supportive and spend money, no issue or perhaps just donate. if you come with a need for massage just have to request no oldies.\n\n",
        "Jack Yiak\n32 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWent for 30min upper body massage. Total waste of money, masseuse was untrained and had no idea what she was doing, no concept of what is muscle, tendon, bone etc, started putting her elbow on my kidneys are, i mean for what?! Just press with her elbows. Came once before and had a guy who was quite good. The problem is there is no consistency in training and technique. Won't go again, just not professional. p/s: It was yesterday (sunday) afternoon, I'd rather not name. Please train your staff and test them properly, there are also other complaints below, if you need to re-test your staff, please do.\n\n",
        "Vivian Ang\nLocal Guide\u00b728 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nReally enjoyed the foot and shoulder massage! My masseur was friendly, experienced and really strong. He made me feel very comfortable and so relieved after the massage. Despite being there during a non-peak period, there was still a lot of customers. So I think it is advisable to book an appointment before heading down! The masseur also customized the massage according to my body\u2019s needs and reaction. Would definitely come back and recommend my friend!\n\n",
        "Bhagyashree L\n4 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nHi\nThis was my first time getting reflexology done . Frankly, it was quite painful. I never expected the foot massage this way. But my masseur assured me that I'll feel better after massage. He (Sam) is quite experienced fellow and he's been doing it for quite some time.\nAfter completing the massage, my feet were feeling very light and numb.\nAs it was my first time, i can't compare it or  call it good or bad.\nThe ambience was good, the staff was friendly. I went without prior appointment. But there was no waiting period.\n\n",
        "Sean Sean\n22 reviews\u00b790 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nVery bad first and probably only experience. With appointment, I have wait for 20min before a masseur is available. Instead of calling it fingerpresss massage, it's more appropriate to call elbow massage. For some reason, 80% of therapy, the masseur elbows you. Highly unpleasant.\n\n",
        "Celine Wong\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nreally pleasant experience at wan lin. went for the full body 45 minutes massage and the lady really hit the sore knots and really made me feel very comfortable and relaxed. she used just the right amount of strength to make me feel both more relieved but at the same time not too painful as well. i almost fell asleep towards the end as it was so comfortable. 10/10 would recommend the oil massage for ppl looking to get relieved and relax.\n\n",

Went for a 40min foot massage and 20min shoulder/back massage. Learnt a lot about my body as to why it hurts and which points are for which part of the body. Time to take good care of my body!  Good and experienced masseur whom explained to me each point he was massaging and what to watch out for like my diet etc. Good experience overall.\n\n",

        "nicnicxun\n8 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTried foot massage at wanlin today, it has been a totally new experience for me! The therapist his name is Wong he can be very quiet, start and end without telling you. However you can tell he is very experienced, he kept on asking me to relax my feet but I couldn\u2019t as it was so painful. But nothing wrong with him I think my body as a lot of aches and problem that\u2019s why causing the pain over the foot. Good try for today, thank you uncle wong but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to do foot massage anymore no matter which shop is that. Haha low pain tolerance.\n\n",
        "Eric Kwok\nLocal Guide\u00b737 reviews\u00b7492 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nOrdered a 1.5 hours of massage. The first 1 hour was fine. Although it was a bit forceful, but I told the masseuse to be softer and the force was alright. At the last thirty minutes she just kept rubbing my neck and my face. The amount of force she pressed in my neck was almost the same force as she would applied on my leg. It was quite uncomfortable and she kept using the same rubbing technique on my neck over and over again. It felt very abrasive on the and I told her to massage other areas instead.\nOverall the massage is quite clean. The only problem is that it feels like it is just brute force pushing all over the body and lacks a little technique. Didn't feel too good afterwards.. a bit of shoulder pain for a few days after the massage.\n\n",
        "Wilson Teo\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent to Wan Lin to get a quick massage fix on a Sunday afternoon. Did a 45mins upper body massage without much expectations. But boy was I surprised at the level of knowledge my masseur know. After a few minutes my masseur knew exactly what was my problem due to me sitting and staring at the computer for long hours. My masseur had real strength which really helped me unknot all my tension on my shoulders and neck. She does check in on me regularly to ensure that I wasn\u2019t in pain. Overall a really pleasant experience and would recommend them to anyone!\n\n",

        "L.J.\nLocal Guide\u00b765 reviews\u00b79 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent there twice for a quick fix as I was experiencing shoulder pains. First time I went, it was a male masseuse. Felt much better after. Second time I went, they assigned me another male masseuse, but because I'd opted for cupping of my back and shoulders, he asked me to change out of my clothing and after sensing I was not comfortable with it, he asked another lady to take over. The lady was good too, released the knots in my shoulders, though still in pain but I'm feeling a lot better compared to before the massage. Price is affordable considering the location.\n\n",
        "Michelle Tang\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a great time here with the friendly masseuse! Came here for a foot and shoulder+neck massage. The masseuse could tell that I exercised often and she also pointed out stiffness in other parts of my body while massaging different parts of my feet. Location is convenient too, will definitely be back!\n\n",
        "Calvin Gwee\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent for a 45min full body massage, and it was a great relief to my constant neck and shoulder stiffness!

The message therapist got the right points with the right pressure to relieve my aching muscles.\n\nThis place will suit you if you prefer remedial massages. If you\u2019re after a western relaxation spa type treatment. This is not the place for you.\n\nThe price was pretty reasonable too. $45 SGD for 1 hour in total.\n\n",

        "Jenny Chung\n4 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI come here since it\u2019s easy to book on the weekend and massage is decent but quite often I will still have to wait for over 15 minutes for a room or a masseuse even with the booking since they are quite busy. Foot massage here is better than body massage.\n\n",
