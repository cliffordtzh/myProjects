        "Gabrielle Chua\nLocal Guide\u00b723 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI've been visiting this massage place for about 4 years now, would go once a month, and I really love their services. I've always asked for M to do my massage as she's really good at it, the strength is just right and she's always able to help me relieve my aches. Would really recommend her if you're looking for authentic and good Thai massage!\n\n",
        "Riz Perreras\n10 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThe massage seems to be random massaging here and there. I said softer but the lady did not understand and continue giving really hard massage. I went with a friend and she feels the same way. Not worth the money and i came out the spa with more pain than when i came in. Not even worth a star.\n\n",
        "Doris Leung\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nTotally 5 stars. I usually go to chinatown for thai massage but they were fully booked so I decided to give this place a chance and no regrets at all!\nTheir style of thai massage is a combination of traditional thai and deep tissue - less twisting of your body but more pressing of your muscle. My masseuse is a thai lady and she gave a very strong massage which totally untied all my knots. I will for sure be back.\n\n",

        "Pramod Nair\nLocal Guide\u00b7160 reviews\u00b7687 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVisit here for no frills authentic massage. $60 for 60 mins is higher than average for the curtain partitioned massage beds.\nApparently the price hike by $5:is recent as I see a 4 month old review at older rates.\n\nOn the plus side it appears comparatively easier to just walk in or book appointments at short notice on most days as the have many therapists.\n\n",
        "Jaron Chua\nLocal Guide\u00b7381 reviews\u00b72,437 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nSlightly pricey but they are professional masseurs. They have two choices; Thai/oil massage, or the aroma hot oil massage. Prices are as listed in the attached image.\n\nIt was painful during the massage but I felt relaxed afterwards. You may let the masseur know how much pressure to you prefer. However I gave only 4 stars as the masseur tend to press very hard on my bones. There was also a time when she was pressing hard on my spine that my legs felt numb.\n\nOtherwise, all was good. Will return if I am in need of a massage\n\n",
        "Mehar Dadhich\nLocal Guide\u00b789 reviews\u00b7125 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nFor me personally this place was good as the massage was good. However, my wife had a bitter experience as her body started to ache as soon as the massage got over. Therefore, 3 starts!\n\n",
        "Scott HH\n1 review\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI paid 80 dollars for a 90mins oil massage therapy. The Thai masseur speaks English and get down to business. No time wasting and not rushing. She finished the massage at 90mins. The session is very good i must say compare to many other spa. she knows exactly what is required for the pressure points. The rooms are clean but a bit dated. That is what you will get. No frills. The receptionist at the desk is strict. Perhaps she can be more polite and friendly instead of only instructing customers i.e. hand sanitizer for cleaning your hands ; take off your shoes .etc. she should have said thank to  a few walk in customers including myself  which she didn't. I was observing when i was at the front desk waiting area. I could have rated them 5 stars. On a whole, it was a pleasant experience to me as the massage is good. No pushing of selling massage package or snake oil.\n\n",
        "Fiona Chin\nLocal Guide\u00b715 reviews\u00b724 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSuper good massage, we had the traditional oil massage for 90 mins, the masseuse hit every pain spots and cracked my back. It\u2019s really just exactly what I wanted and needed, thank you May! You are really great.\n\n",
        "HanJie Cheng\nLocal Guide\u00b731 reviews\u00b783 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\ncounter staff was alright and that's it. I don't feel any lighter anywhere in the body. in fact I had to go for another round of massage the next day...\n\n",
        "Christian Branzuela\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWorst massage experience ever. The lady didn\u2019t understand I needed a softer massage. I ended up feeling stressed instead of relaxed. I also need to take painkillers after due to pain. Not recommended for people who just want a relaxing chill massage.\n\n",
        "Ben\n15 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nNeed a professional massage? This is the place to go to! Decent pricing and the masseuse always does a great job! Clean place too!\n\n",
        "Jun\n4 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nMostly painful when the masseuse press even after asking her to press softly. Not sure why the reviews give 4 stars.\n\n",

        "Jack Le\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis is always my go-to massage place. I've been visiting this place monthly to relieve my my muscle pain in shoulder, back and neck. I would recommend Jasmine as my favorite but other masseurs are also very nice. Thank you!\n\n",

        "Jane \uc11c\ud604 Park\nLocal Guide\u00b7113 reviews\u00b783 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nI had jasmine as my masseuse and she was so kind and strong. She tailors it according to where you feel more need for. It was so good i initially paid for 60 min and extended it to 90. Strongly recommend!\n\nEdit: went a second time, had a different lady and it felt like she was just going thru the motions instead of truly massaging. Didnt feel that great after paying a steep 75 dollars for 90 min. Waste of money and time\n\n",
        "Woo Cher Chong Joe\nLocal Guide\u00b761 reviews\u00b7696 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\n2nd time over period of 6 days to relief my super tensed muscle, from shoulder to calves. It's definitely a place to recommend.\nWill be returning for few more sessions to lessen especially tight calves which is affecting my walking normally.\n\n",
        "Catherine Chien\n17 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nNo frills thai massage - quality of the massage was high and the price was reasonable. The masseuse put her knees on my super stiff back and that helped loosen up the knots. Deco could be improved.\n\n",
        "Darryl Tok\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a back pain this morning. So decided to try to this Thai massage after seeing many good review. Massage by a thai lady who knows how to speak chinese. Really good skill and my back pain all gone after 90 mins. Recommended to go. Will go back there  when having back pain again. Overall a very good experience. The price is reasonable as well. Can look for \u201cM\u201d if you wants to have a good massage to release your back pain.\n\n",
        "SYP Tan\n12 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nFirst visit was pleasant and Thai lady did a good job. To be honest this is one of the best Thai Massage in Singapore and price is reasonable SGD110 for 120 mins or SGD 75 for 90 mins. Will definitely come back again.\n\n",
        "Kevin\n15 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nLegit clean and good massage place.\nDoes a good job to ease my muscles aches and \"cracking\" / loosening my joints.\n\n",
        "Drew Goh\nLocal Guide\u00b7283 reviews\u00b72,891 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWas a little concerned that it's sleazy, but it's not (coz of the area)! The Thai auntie who did my massage cracked bones with her feet, and massaged away a lot of my soreness.\n\nShe would ask if a certain area needed more to relieve the soreness, though one minor downside was her trying to get me to do 90 mins instead of the 60. That said, the massage is superb. Waiting room is a little small and dingy, but the massage bed that I was assigned was clean.\n\n",
        "Shi Min Ng\nLocal Guide\u00b7113 reviews\u00b7612 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nProfessional and felt so much better after the massage! The back crack felt sooo good\n\n",

        "mel lee\n8 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nCame for 60 min Thai traditional (no oil) massage on a public holiday. From reception to interior the place smells very strongly like moth balls. Was led to a table and expected to disrobe\u2014 I had to remind them I wanted no-oil massage, then after giving me clothes to change into they left me alone waiting for more than 5 minutes.\n\nSAFETY & COMMUNICATION: Masseuse spoke Mandarin and did not understand English, so when I had to inform to please not place body pressure on the metal plate I have in my forearm, we struggled to communicate. Later, she seemed to have weak understanding of technique or her own body form, as when she bent my leg to the side she went right for my spine not my hips\u2014 I thought alright, maybe it\u2019s a style. Then switching to the left she seemed to have a different approach, and when pressing onto the joints to the side of my spine, laid her support hand directly on top of the center of my spine. I yelped in pain and seemed to surprise her. She couldn\u2019t understand what I was reacting to. Her touch was intended well perhaps but was fierce and imprecise. At the end, when I took a few mins to recover myself (it was not yet a full hour), she came back after setting my tea outside again surprised, saying they needed to clear the room for the next customer. There are no customers waiting and there are other rooms available. Perhaps she\u2019s only been trained to churn and burn?\n\nWill not return. According to other reviews there might be better experiences \u2014 my masseuse was Ying, who might work for people who aren\u2019t that aware of their body and like this approach.\n\n",
        "Mei Yin W.\n4 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nWent on 12 Jul afternoon, paid for oil massage. Wasn't informed by the receptionist that oil massage is unavailable. Until I was in the massage room, the lady covered me few layers of towel and press above the towel which I thought it was a warm up. Aft about 20 mins, I asked the massage lady whether there is oil massage, the lady told me oil massage is unavailable as per government's guidelines during covid period.\n\nAfter massage is done, my hubby in the next room came out and told me he had oil massage. So I was fooled by the receptionist or the massage lady...?\n\n4 star because the massage is still done well & hubby enjoyed it too.\n\n",
        "Kieran Hearley\nLocal Guide\u00b741 reviews\u00b78 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nPretty decent massage. Therapist was very skilled and when I said my shoulders needed work she 100% nailed it. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is due to the staff constantly talking throughout the rooms. It's quite off-putting when trying to relax. Otherwise really reasonably priced massage!\n\n",
        "Anika\n12 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWorst massage I've ever been to. The masseuse had incredibly long nails and dry callous hands which made it incredibly uncomfortable - basically scratching my entire body raw. Would not recommend or come back. Also very rough in style and rushed. I've been to hundreds of Thai massage places and this was the worst. Whenever you ask for softer hands, she would just laugh at you with the other ladies and wouldn't change her method. My body is sore and bruised. Terrible service. When I mentioned this at the end of the massage to the main lady running the business - she was too busy counting her cash at the til to even care. Poor service!\n\n",
        "Anand Subramanian\nLocal Guide\u00b774 reviews\u00b717 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGreat place. Consistency changes with the masseuse but great nevertheless\n\n",
        "Harsh Vardhan\nLocal Guide\u00b779 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nLoved the ambience. Prices are OK. The masseuse Judy had strong hands and all the pressure points were taken care off. I no longer feel the stiffness in my lower back and shoulders. I tried catching a quick power nap as well :) but occasionally masseuse were talking within themselves hence that kept me awake. But overall a very good experience. The massage service is very professional and my masseuse seemed very experienced. Thumbs Up!\n\n",
        "mervin oh\nLocal Guide\u00b721 reviews\u00b737 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nMassage is solid but too pushy to extend time. Spoils the experience. Otherwise it's fine.\n\n",
        "Kelly Hall\nLocal Guide\u00b773 reviews\u00b7141 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy mother and I experienced very relaxing massage is here. We were both treated respectfully and had our individual needs and requests met. The facility was clean, quiet, and provided for our privacy. I would highly recommend healing Thai massage.\n\n",
        "Bakhtiar Iskandar\nLocal Guide\u00b72 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAll the masseuses are well trained and cater to your preference..will definitely recommend anyone looking for pure Thai massage...\n\n",
        "Karen Kupfer\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nExceptional thai massage with an exceptional masseuse. These women work hard everyday and yet they provide a high quality massage at each and every time. I gave her a tip, the price (90 mins = 75$ and available right away) is more than fair and the massage was really great. I would encourage tourists to always leave a tip, there is a lot of hard work and not always recognized. Thank you to the lady that made my day with this massage! Loved it\n\n",
        "Jambay D\nLocal Guide\u00b795 reviews\u00b735 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSuperb massage. I was blown away by the quality and the authenticity of the thai massage. Reasonable price considering you are in Singapore.\n\nI was attended to by Ivy who was not only skillful but professional and always concerned if I was doing fine.\n\nWill be coming back again.\n\n",
        "Leimoon Manaw\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nRecommended by a friend to Healing Thai. Great experience. Felt really relaxed after the session, masseuse (Bella) applied the right strengths to where i felt tense. And i felt she really put in effort to her job making sure i feel relaxed through out the whole session. Will definitely come back again.. good job!!\n\n",
        "Singh Singh\nLocal Guide\u00b7193 reviews\u00b7105 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIf u want a massage that will hit all the right spots and loose all ur knots and leave u feeling totally stress free. This is the place. I am visiting Singapore and I went there before our check in and fell in love the place and their services and customer care and they way they simply make u feel at home.\n\nTotal professionals with very experienced staff. Complete value for the money spent.\n\n",
        "Lauren Kate\nLocal Guide\u00b744 reviews\u00b724 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a great Thai massage with Evon then stayed for a foot massage with Peter. Walked in and was able to get both appointments with minimal wait. Clean, comfortable place. Ginger tea complimentary! Highly recommend and would return if I were to have longer in Singapore!\n\nFriendly, efficient reception!\n\n",
        "James Bong\n10 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGreat place to enjoy Thai Massage without going to Thailand . Masseurs here very professional and the skill level is great. Now I miss the massage so much hope CB will end soon.\n\n",
        "Jennifer Lee\n19 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have never try thai massage in Singapore but this as good as it can get, comparing to Thailand. Very good pressure massage. I love it!\n\n",
        "Andy Low\nLocal Guide\u00b7121 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis is the other reasonably cheap and professional Thai massage parlours in Singapore, right before Loy Krathong Thai massage in Aljunied. The authentic Thai masseuses here are very skillful and mindful if you mention about existing injuries. The place is well-kept, clean and has a nice ambience. As someone who does sports regularly and is prone to soreness and muscular injuries, I find that the massages here really helped me in recovering. Highly recommended place!\n\n",
        "Nalaka Warnakula\n14 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent to get a massage as I was having a stiff neck and sore upper and lower back. Price was reasonable, service was good and professional.\n\n",
        "Tom Drake\nLocal Guide\u00b779 reviews\u00b728 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI have had 100s of Thai massages before (no exaggeration) and that was hands down the best one! Payed for 1hr 30m with Rse. She was from Thailand like the rest of the masseuses and was definitely very experienced. She applied hard/firm force and knew exactly what needed work. I feel like the 90 mins was the correct time needed to cover everything properly. I think what makes a good masseuse is that they can find your troubled spots without you telling them, and she did exactly that. 10/10\n\n",
        "Adil Moosajee\nLocal Guide\u00b724 reviews\u00b717 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThis is one of the worst foot massage experiences.\nThe lady didn\u2019t know her pressure points and was too old (no disrespect intended) to put right amount of pressure. She kept rubbing and hitting bone instead of muscle.\nExtremely saddened by this experience\n\n",
        "Thomas Sander\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery nice massage as always. Happy they finally open during CB phase 2. Safety measures in place for Covid-19 to ensure great and healthy experience\n\n",
        "Brijesh Bolar\nLocal Guide\u00b7128 reviews\u00b7294 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI must say I am really impressed by their massage service. Good for family with professional masseuse service. I felt so good after the body massage that I actually gave a tip to my masseuse.\n\n",
        "David LIM\nLocal Guide\u00b750 reviews\u00b78 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSecond visit. Massueur is Ivy. Right from the start, she got all the points of knot correct. The feeling of blocked lactic acid can't be described by my vocabulary but for those with tight aching muscles will know what I mean. Highly recommended!\n\n",
        "Martin Dietze\nLocal Guide\u00b721 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nExcellent. I came there with constant headache due to problems in shoulders and neck.

        "Paul T\nLocal Guide\u00b758 reviews\u00b7148 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nTo be fair the first time i went the massuese was pretty good. Subsequent massuese is bad, have had thai massages for years and this is not thai. Just random pressing here and there. Feels like no proper training. Asked counter for a refund after 10 minutes but was rudely rejected, saying that masseuse have 20 years experience. My first bad review on google, couldnt let this slide\n\n",
        "Zsoka Scurtescu\nLocal Guide\u00b771 reviews\u00b764 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nIt was ok, but I expected a bit more based on the reviews. It's clean enough, but could be cleaner. The ladies were nice. Mine was quite gentle, which I didn't mind, but my husband's was more strong/painful (in a good way), so it really depends on who you get.\n\n",
        "Eddy Ng\n4 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThis place gave me the best thai massage ever. My masseur applied sufficient force and awesome massage, my stiff muscles are gone. I will definitely revisit this place again and again. Totally awesome place.\n\n",

        "Ris Thevan\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI would not come here ever. The masseuse was a much older lady who was so rough and I kept telling her that she is massaging my bones. Not my muscle. Then she goes on to use her knees to place pressure on my back. I told her its too much and she started complaining in mandarin on how I was being difficult becoz I didnt want my bones massaged. Only for her to realize that I understood mandarin and she was stumped. Im left with a kink in my back now thanks to her.\nDefinitely going back to Sabaai.\n\n",
