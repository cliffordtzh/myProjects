Strong and professional like Hazel.\nPlace was clean and air conditioned.\nWould go back for another massage from Hazel or Karen.\n\n",

        "Dean Lim\n7 reviews\u00b716 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBest massage with Yuna in  Le Mandarin Spa.  They are totally legit, no funny business or shady dealing. Yuna is amazing, friendly and understanding. I feel great after every session! I feel more energetic; more relaxed physically, emotionally and mentally; any aches and pains I may have had going in (headaches, muscle aches, pinched nerves) are all relieved when my session is complete. Far superior to any chain or private masseuse I\u2019ve tried.\n\n",

        "Crystal Artemis\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI have been trying massage in different shop nearly every week if my regular ship is full.\n\nFirst time I try this Le Mandarin Spa now.\nThe receptionist lady said must take 90 mins to massage the abdomen area. Yes I agreed that and I usually take 60 mins/90 mins.\n\nEveryone knows that every minutes are important on massage.\n\nEnd up, the girl who massage me finish in 10 mins earlier and I was like how comes they left without doing  all the frontal areas of the body (the palm of hand, arms, abdomen areas, toes)\n\nMoreover, she doesn\u2019t know how to massage the head properly. I have short hair around the ear length but she is stuck with my hair. Finally, she knows how to end the head massage. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 when other people hit 5 times, she hits me 15 times until I headache again.\n\nFurthermore , they come in when I haven\u2019t finished changing. Not only these, she denied that she gave full 90 mins. Lucky, I was remembered what time she started and what time she ended. When I said nicely that she left 10 mins earlier then , she started to yell me\nThis is the point makes me angry and push me to share this review.\nWe paid full amount according to what they asked for. I didn\u2019t take any promotions at all. I am sure the service is needed to be done fully.\n\nThe receptionist lady said next time they will give discounts. OH NO pls\u2026\n\nDefinitely NO NEED TO STEP IN this kind of shop again.\n\nIf you guys wants to try this kind of horrible shop due to any promotions, remember to see the watch before you start and once you end.\n\n",

A very good therapist who is caring for her client and communicate well. After the massage, my backache is almost done. Very nice of her and her skill is superior! Thank you Soda!

        "John Tan\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nJust had a 1hr full body massage with Snow. Remarkable therapist. Despite her petite frame, her massage techniques are strong and precise. Her skills are also very seasoned as she released all the tension in my back and neck. Friendly and cheerful, a plus point for me.\n\nVery nice atmosphere as well, clean room and comforting music. Definetly would return, and would pick Snow again!!\n\n",
        "Cao Nguy\u00ean L\u00ea\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nBeen here twice and got mixed result with Vietnamese therapist:\n- First time I tried hot oil therapy with Snow. She was not very friendly, and her massage skill was bad. She applied more pressure than necessary and not at correct point. My body & neck felt ache for the following week. The cost was $89.\n- Today I tried hot oil therapy & foot reflexology with Timi, she is nice and her body massage skill is very good. Her foot massage skill is just average. Total cost for the combo was $112.\nOverall I think this place is a bit overpriced, and you have to select the therapist carefully. A minus point for today is that Snow was at the reception, and her attitude didn't improve at all.\nUnless Snow improved her skill & serving attitude, don't choose her.\n\n",

        "Michel Ang\n6 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI think this place really deserves a good review. Clean and exceptional body massage that  I had visited today. I have gotten the body massage by the therapist name Vina. She is well trained with great personality. It was amazing that I was served with good massage skill, fixed my muscle pain. One little improvement needed is no music during secession. However, overall was excellent. Thank you Vina.\n\n",
        "Felicia Prasetya\nLocal Guide\u00b716 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nThe masseuse that I got tried to sell me additional services costing extra $31 which I politely refused but she subsequently started complaining about other places services which I think it\u2019s not professional. I think she also ended my session a bit earlier but it\u2019s ok because it\u2019s very uncomfortable as everything is so painful and what I find a bit unpleasant is when you just want a quiet massage and the masseuse keep complaining? My husband went for the foot massage and he also has a similar experience whereby the masseuse keep complaining. His is worse because she also complains about how hard his skin was? Really not a very professional and customer centric place....\n\n",

She was easy to talk to and customer oriented\uff0cmassage  my stiff neck and backache was to the point. She was able to apply appropriate pressure to those areas and relieve my pain.

        "Z P\nLocal Guide\u00b7103 reviews\u00b7289 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nLove that the massage wasn't too painful. The masseuse also check where she needed to focus which was very thoughtful. It would be cosy if the bedwarmer is provided as the centralised aircon was too cold and to turn down the music to have a more zen calming experience. I recommend the couple massage as it is value for money.\n\n",
        "Sebastian Ng\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWill always look for Miki. She applies the right pressure to loosen my knots. She also makes sure that the hot oil is of the right temperature.

        "anurag tripathi\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nA SPA is as good as its masseuse. A good Masseuse should exhibit both Knowledge and Technique, in addition to the right temperament. I have a perennial back problem and have been visiting CASEY for the past few months. I find that she has all the above qualities. I would gladly recommend her. The fact that she is able to make small conversations in English is an added advantage.\n\n",

Other places that I go don\u2019t have the initiative to inform their staff that I don\u2019t speak Chinese and yet this place took notice.

        "Martin Lee\n1 review\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nFriend said good. So walk-in. Assigned Angeline (shop busy, 10 min.wait). off to the rm. Usual small talk - she asked where u usual go - I said B. Timah. Then I asked where u train, SG? She quite emotional said all PRC therapist trained 1by1 in China, only their is \u6b63\u5b97(pls lah, this place is not TCM hall)\u3002i asked how about your Vn colleague,  their not genuine mah (i.e.\u6b63\u5b97\uff09\uff1fNow she quite upset, said whatever u want to believe, Then I further asked, I go BKK they also said their is \u6b63\u5b97, how? She off the boil now. Sending this is not going to be a happy episode, asked for a change of therapist. Lucky shop obliged (another 5-10 min.wait). Eventually left a happy human being.

        "Yongquan\n14 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nOverall, a really bad place do not waste your money here. Firstly, the service at the counter is bad; bad attitude and the lady looks like she hates her job; pushy and will attempt push you to pay a higher amount; do not fall for it. Then the place is dirty and the aircon is too cold. The experience will be really uncomfortable for you... And the massage was horrible. Do any of the girl even know how to give a massage? Anyone who watches a Youtube video tutorial would do the job 10 times better. Finally, this is not a clean place at all despite mall the signs within the spa of it being clean, even though you make it clear you only want a massage they will insist, be pushy and unhappy about it!!! Do not come here!\n\nAnd i'm pretty sure the reply below is \"just for show\" just like all the signs inside. Do not go. You will regret it - it's a really smelly and gross place\n\n",
