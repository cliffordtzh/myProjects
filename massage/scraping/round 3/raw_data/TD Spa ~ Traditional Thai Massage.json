        "Felicia Prasetya\nLocal Guide\u00b716 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nManaged to book a last min slot at this place. Good quality and authentic Thai massage. Similar to what you will get if you are in Thailand. Price is also reasonable. I was a bit worried at first since this is my first time trying but I really liked the massage.\n\nUncle at counter was also polite to clients.\n\n",
        "Mal C\nLocal Guide\u00b737 reviews\u00b729 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThis is not authentic Thai massage. The women aren't trained. I asked for extra hard thai massage and was terribly let down. I wanted to walk out after 5 mins into the massage but was told that another massuse who could massage hard and well would be available in about 30mins. I waited as I had already prepaid. It was the most hyped up massage that left me disappointed and totally unrelieved. I felt more stiff after than I did walking in there. I asked for more pressure but received less pressure. I also asked for shoulders and traps but got my arms massaged instead. I asked for glutes and hamstrings but got my calves massaged instead. I then got told I should stretch everyday and that I worked on a keyboard that's why I have tight traps. Both comments were not relevant as I do stretch everyday and I dont use a keyboard ever. Its like the massuse was making it up as she went along. She was saying how she has massaged for over 20years but she was atrociously inaccurate in her diagnosis and inaccurate with her massage. Both massuses were terrible. I wasted $55 and 90mins of my life there.\nIn conclusion, this place is good for people who don't know what thai massage is and who want untrained women hitting your spine with their elbow and not knowing anything about the human body. How this place has over a 4 star rating is beyond me.\n\n",

Even she is small size but she have a good strength and will concentrate on your request of where should get more attention. Overall very good session will visit again.\n\n",

        "R. Perrie\nLocal Guide\u00b725 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nEXTREMELY RUDE STAFF. DO NOT GO.\n\nFirst time going. Booked a session for my mum and me at 1050pm for 90mins. Told the lady I am looking forward to the massage as I heard good review- I am coming all the way from Tampines.\n\nArrived around 1030pm and sat at coffeeshop to drink water and got a call- hello can shift to 1120pm? I said I was already outside 1120 quite late what happened? Plus I booked for 90mins! Got no bus later. Mentioned that a customer came late. I said, oh dear should have told them to shorten as you have other customer- or inform me earlier. ( i don't think this is an unfair request- massage is  at least 1hour long- u inform me only 20mins before for a 30min++ delay??)\n\nMan started to yell me at me 'BOOKING IS A PREVILEGE! WE  NEVER EVEN TAKE MONEY FOR YOUR BOOKING! AT LEAST WE COURTESY CALL YOU!'\n\nTo which i hung up because no one should listen to such rudeness. Standards so low- apparently we must be happy they never ask money for booking and be grateful that they give a call when they the ones that screw up.\n\nThere are many other places in this times of covid that need business- this place apparently business too good so staff can afford to be so rude to customer! MUST AVOID. Not worth the time.\n\n",
        "Ashyikin\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had Ms Kim twice as my masseur and she is aaaamazing! She helped me with my backpain and joint stiffness and I went home feeling alive! She is attentive and very professional, def knows what she's doing.\n\n",
        "jewel lim\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe masseuse Lynn was really great, she knows all of my pressure points and was able to hit each and every one of them. Highly recommended!\n\n",
        "Jude T\n5 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGood decent massage.  Professional and of good strength. Would go again if in the area.\n\n",
        "Shin\n6 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nI was here due to the good reviews, but was terribly disappointed. My masseuse was inexperienced although she had a pretty good attitude, but the experience was unpleasant and non thai-like, where pressure applied on bones and wrists? light squeezes on arms, thighs and unusually long rubs on neck. Did not alleviate muscle soreness.\n\nI did overhear the next door customer complimenting the other masseuse, so I think experience varies with who you are allocated.\n\nAmendment: there was a mistake in my pricing comment, so I have redacted it.\n\n",
        "Nurhidayah Aziz\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFor me its the best thai message I've ever experienced. At first I was skeptical as rarely do massage parlours have their massages on the floor. However, after going through the massage I think all massage parlours should do their massages on the floor. Only then can the massage be done with full effort and those hard to reach places like inner thighs can be stretched. I fully recommend this place.\n\n",
        "Azroy\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time been there, good massage by the thailand woman. She did well compare to other spa that i've been to. Clean enviroment no hanky panky feel much better after massage. Recommended!\n\n",
        "Ashton Chong\nLocal Guide\u00b726 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nStrong authentic Thai massage, with the masseuse constantly asking you if the pressure is good enough. Indeed the pressure was good! For those who are wondering I'm 6ft tall and generally people who try to crack my back often lose balance and fall down, this lady steady can crack my back without losing balance. Not for the weak minded looking for a gentle backrub.\n\n",
        "Jeremiah Wee\nLocal Guide\u00b721 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent down after having 5 days of bad neck sches, severe enough to prevent me from turning my head left to right fully. Had a solid 1hr massage and left being able to turn without pain again! I'll be making this a regular massage place for sure...\n\n",
        "Zack Goh\n7 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBest late night legit massage. A gem in Singapore. Kim is a very good massesue. Strongly recommend place to come. Thanks!\n\n",
        "Vishnu Suresh\nLocal Guide\u00b718 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nCame here with a neck pain due to wrong sleeping prosture and body fatigue accumulated over running.\nThe Thai massage offered by Lily was amazing and helped me relieve the neck. Worth the price. Thanks.\n\n",
        "Urvashi Bhalode\nLocal Guide\u00b722 reviews\u00b713 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nOne of the best massages I've had in Singapore. Thanks a lot to the lady, Da, who was great with the back massage!\n\n",
        "zealous lim\n10 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nEdit: reduced to 3 stars due to an unpleasant visit on 23/12/20 after being a regular here for 3 years.\n\nA new hire was assigned who was inexperienced and had a big room for improvement. Better QC should have been in place to Ensure competency of masseuse.\n\nIt was so bad I had to stop the massage halfway approx 25 mins left. Shop offered refund $7 for my 25/60 mins ($55) massage left which left me confused. Rejected the refund and left an unhappy customer.\n\nPrevious review:\n\nExcellent authentic massage service in the heartlands. May wish to call for an appointment before heading down. Wendy is an excellent masseuse, never fails to knead those aches away. Price is reasonable and facilities are clean and comfortable.\n\n",
        "Alex \u201cGramsturn Null\u201d\n13 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nHad at 90 mins body massage yesterday that was just dreadful. The masseuse was inexperienced and not using any kind of massage technic. All she was doing was pressing her hands and elbows into my skin repeatedly with her full body weight, this is not massage!. I came here because of the high reviews but the reviews do not match with the massage i received yesterday.\n\n",
        "Andy Low\nLocal Guide\u00b7121 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nReally cozy and clean Thai massage establishment in Bedok. A hidden gem. Very friendly reception service and masseuses. Also they are much more cheaper than the other establishments in the city area. I can't recommend this place enough.\n\n",
        "ben chin\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt was my first time over here and I had an amazing experience. The owner of this place is polite and answers your queries honestly. The interior of this establishment is clean and cozy. Therapists are experienced and know exactly what they are doing. Do not be afraid of Therapists using too much/little strength. There was clear communication between therapist and customer as well. Good location I must say for east siders! I will definitely recommend anyone, from having a relaxing massage, or to the fitness enthusiasts. This is the place to be \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n\n",
        "Introvert With A Backpack\nLocal Guide\u00b7161 reviews\u00b7167 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time to try the spa since it\u2019s a near our place. I had a very nice 90-min massage. Shoulders and back pain gone. A refreshing hot tea after the massage. Staff seems nice too. Would definitely recommend.\n\n",
        "Chee Ming Shum\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI just had my first massage at TD Spa with my daughter. It was a great experience and we felt so refreshed after the massage. The staff were polite and attentive. I will definitely go back to have more massage.\n\n",
        "Joel Ng\n7 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a neck and shoulder ache. Went down for massage. I would say Kim is very experienced and the next morning all the ache was gone.\n\n",
        "Ari Nas (ary214)\n3 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt\u2019s very hard to find a decent spa, especially in the east. TD Spa is not just decent. They are full out legit. The owner and masseuse are very polite. And the massage, bro, confirm won\u2019t regret. You just tell her what\u2019s aching. She\u2019s do her best to remedy it. Power la. 5 stars. Terbaik.\n\n",
        "Melvin PP\nLocal Guide\u00b738 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI love thai massage and was giving this space a try. To my surprise it is the best thai massage Ive ever tried in Singapore. Im sure in Thailand too. Told the staff about my neck and shoulder problems. Previously, I only believed that a massage session is as good as it lasts. But this is the first place that took my pain away. Thank you. I will be there again. Please keep up the standards and the affordable pricing.\n\n",
        "Leon Lim\n5 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nLousy massage by Kim. Asked me any specific place need to massage, after telling her I have lower back pain she did not really focus on the lower back. So, what\u2019s the point of asking?\n\n",
        "Elgin Lam\nLocal Guide\u00b734 reviews\u00b770 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFantastic massage. A hidden gem in the east. My shoulder was hurting quite badly but the masseuse managed to reduce the pain significantly in just one session. She also knew which spots to press to relieve pain around the body. Thumbs up\n\n",
        "Sonia Fernandez\n4 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThe massage was just plain disappointing. The \"masseuse\" was extremely inexperienced and kept looking at the time. It was a full body massage but she only focused on my legs. What a waste of money.\n\n",
        "Yeo Vanessa\n4 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nTheir massage is really good. However, the management needs to improve in their service. We requested for 2 in a room way in advance but when we reach there, they told us we have to be separated as they have customers inside. This happened a few times despite us giving them feedback.\n\n",
        "Jay Jang (\ub9d0\ub808\uc774\ub140\uc11d\ub4e4)\nLocal Guide\u00b743 reviews\u00b7169 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nYesterday was my last visiting this shop. The massager was not professional and doesn't know how to massage well. Even she spent over 20min for only one spot of my temple. Moreover she has finished 10min earlier of my 2hr massage. No worth anymore.\n\n",
        "Christopher Rodd\n2 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI had just arrived following a long journey from Europe . Before I left I found TD Spa in a google search and booked a 90 minute massage . it was well worth it . A superb masseur who clearly knew what she was doing . it was an excellent and very professional deep tissue massage . Well worth the very reasonable promotional price of  $68 .\nThe only down side was the fact that conditions were a bit cramped for the masseur , which was less than ideal  Absent that one criticism I would have given them 5 stars\n\n",
        "Stephanie Yeo\n4 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThe first time i came here, i had a great experience as they assigned a thai therapist to me. This time i came again, and they assigned a Chinese therapist who claimed she knew thai massage. For those who understand thai massage, it\u2019s nothing like your swedish or aromatherapy massage with effleurages. She was trying to complete the one hour massage with just light touches and oil massage throughout. She used zero thai massage techniques and the pressure was completely soft and hard, and she could not tell the difference between bones and muscles. She had hands of a sandpaper. Just imagine being tortured throughout. I could tell she probably never graduated from a Thai massage school at all.\n\n",
        "adelyn CSL\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nworth every penny of my money.. cheap and good! my favourite therapist is nadia ive been here for many years.. she is very attentive and she is very experience.. her style of massage is different from others but really soothes the pain and aches away.. a must visit spa.. though its a small spa, the people here are very kind and friendly.

        "World Explorer\nLocal Guide\u00b779 reviews\u00b741 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI went there on my second last day in Singapore, pretty impressed. I had my shoulder strained and after this Thai massage it went away immediately. Relaxed. Just few tips: Remember to mention how much pressure we want, else you may feel pain. Only cons here is, masseuse keep talking with each other. Bit noisy...\n\n",

        "teresa khoo\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nLack of Business ethics.  My appointment for Husband and I was for an hour massage at 3.30pm. But when we texted to inform we would be 10 mins late due to traffic, we were informed to go at 4 pm because they gave allowed a customer to extend for 1/2 hour to 4 pm.  How could they do this when they have accepted advance appointments? Ridiculous!\n\n",
        "Leng Leng Kwek\n9 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWent on sat morn. Perhaps too early, The recept lady told me cant do foot, can only do body. The environment is clean, no unpleasant smell, plus point 2 toilets at the back. But the masseue did like 50/50 oil n acupoint massage throughout the 1.5hr. My body vy tense n hard yet she used a lot elbowing n crushing on my body. Makes my backpain worse. Dont find her professional enough.\n\n",
