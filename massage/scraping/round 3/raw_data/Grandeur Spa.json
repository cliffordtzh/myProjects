        "ZW Fatty\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGrandeur Spa is my regular go to place due to the nice ambience and friendly staffs. Just had another session with my regular masseuse Fara. Fara is skillful and very experience in her massage. She is very soft spoken and knows how to make you relax and enjoy the massage session. Though petite but she applies enough strength to your body especially on those pressure points to release the muscle tension. Be sure to come back weekly for my regular massage. Also would like to compliment to Elise and Meimei the friendly receptionist, good job. What I love most about this place is they are very attentive to you and most importantly the masseuse does not play with phone and gives you 110% attention. Thanks again Fara for the amazing massage therapy, Elise and Mei Mei for the  good hospitality.\n\n",

The ambience was pleasantly relaxing and signing in was efficient and professional.\nI was attended to by Elsa who gave me a wonderful relaxing massage. Elsa is suprisingly strong for such a tiny girl and can provide whichever pressure you prefer. Good technique and left me feeling very satisified. Will definitely choose Elsa again for my next visit.\n\n",

The massage did not take place 1 hour..i guess its around 45 mins as i need to wait them change the bedsheet. I was just getting massage on the back, without having massage in front of my body.. However, i give 3 star due to the good skill of massage therapist as she know the spots which my back aches..\n\n",

Booked a slot and was assigned Fara.\n\nFara has strong hands, good fingers, elbows and feet that walked all over my back. Squeezing out all the lactic acids that have accumulated over working the past weeks.  Joints, neck and head were all relieved.\n\nAfter the 90 min session, I was refreshed. Standing taller with the accumulated aches and pains all soothed out. Will visit her again soon.\n\n",
        "EUGENE PANG\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI would like to give special thanks to my regular therapist Fara. She is friendly and also skilled. Although petite in size but she her massage is strong and also knows the exact spots to ease my aching body after a long day at work. I would rate her a 10/10 for massage and also for professionalism. 60 mins isn\u2019t enough for a session, would recommend to go for at least a 90 mins session where you can relax and feel refreshed after the massage. Definitely a go to place for a great massage as the other places which I have been too just massage terribly ending with a worst body ache after or the massage therapist would plays with their phone and sometimes end even before the 60 or 90 mins duration. Thanks for the nice ambience and also the great massage from Fara. Will definitely be back and to recommend more customers.\n\n",

I took the $89 massage. The masseus who served me was Elsa. Elsa was very good with her hands and was able to converse proficiently in Chinese so I was able to tell her which areas of my body were sore. Overall, I was very satisfied with Elsa's service and will definitely return again regularly to look for Elsa. Keep up the good work!\n\n",

        "Quentin Jacobson\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI went back to Grandeur Spa for the second time this week. I love to get my massage after a week's worth of work and today was a perfect day as it was raining heavily. I came as a walk-in, so I wasn't expecting any therapist in particular. So when my session began, I was greeted by this super lovely and cute therapist Vicky.\n\nVicky's massage was so on point that I am booking all my future appointments with her from now on! :) Her professionalism during the session makes me so comfortable that an hour's session feels so short. She may be a small girl, but she is strong to handle my big sized body.\n\nLooking forward to the next relaxing session with Vicky, and the next time would be a longer session! 100/100!\n\n",

        "Khalid H.\nLocal Guide\u00b76 reviews\u00b772 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nBooked a full body massage at their \u2018promo\u2019 price of $55. Turned up at 11am for my appointment and was immediately told that this promo is not a full body, only back and legs. Got really confused and showed the receptionist \u2018Fara\u2019 that it literally says full body massage. She pushes me to some hot oil massage instead for $89 that I really didn\u2019t need. She said that only this is full body, not just back and legs. I said I\u2019m fine without getting any head or neck massage so the fake \u2018full body\u2019 promo is good for me. Suddenly another lady comes into the fray and asks  Fara what\u2019s going on etc. She then tells me the promo is only back massage, nothing else. I then tell her that it says full body, but even then Fara just said back and legs? Both of them now really become really push me and insist on the hot oil massage for $89. I keep shutting them down and we agree on a promo massage (keeping this as short as possible). They then ask me what girl I want, China, Vietnam. I was really confused - not sure why my alarms bells didn\u2019t go off even more here. I said anyone will do. Here comes Elsa\u2026 the badgering to switch to the expensive hot oil massage doesn\u2019t stop and she again says this promo is for back only. She was visibly frustrated but I said they just told me it\u2019s back and legs. She says okay for legs but no thighs, which again I was really confused about and said fine. She begins what is the furthest thing from a massage I have ever experienced. She says if I don\u2019t switch this massage really hurts, the hot oil is a lot better. She was literally causing physical pain to get me to switch, pinching the sides of my neck and then elbowing my backbone area. She then leaves and presumably tells front desk that I\u2019m not switching. She comes back in and switches the aircon off, kind you it\u2019s a really small and stuffy room. After about a minute I turn and say please turn the air com off it\u2019s very hot. She screams as if I stole her handbag or something and says my mask is not perfectly on, she is actually shouting. It was obvious she was not interested in the cheaper massage and everyone was very angry that I didn\u2019t get some hot oil massage. At this point, not sure why it took me this long, I got up and demanded a refund and left. I did a bit of google searching after this experience, and wow- so many reviews with the same experience except they were all smarter to leave a lot earlier than I did! A simple search on forums also clearly reveals that this place is really only interested in providing \u2018special\u2019 services. Visit their official Facebook page and see for yourself if this is a legit place.\n\n",

She asked what was ailing me before the session started and the session was not only very therapeutic and relaxing for me, but she also managed to make me feel very comfortable through her friendly small talks.\n\nCoupled with her good massage techniques I would say she is one of the best masseuse I\u2019ve had in a while!

My therapist Fara has been very patient with me and also recommended me their shop's signature hot oil package during my first session. Fara's massage skill was amazing and on point. She is very friendly and also made my feel comfortable throughout the session. If i could rate her, it would be a 10/10. For those who visit the spa, would recommend a minimum of 90mins or 120mins session (hot oil package), definitely no regrets. Thanks again to Fara (Therapist) and Elise (receptionist) for the awesome customer service. Would definitely be back again for my weekly massage. =)\n\n",

        "Paige B.\n10 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nI would love to give this place a higher rating - but this was far too noisy to offer anything close to a relaxing experience.\n\nPros:\n- We were able to book last minute, day-of\n- Facilities were clean and had a nice aesthetic\n- Technician was good\n\nCons:\n- Absurdly loud - From a loud banging noise for 15-minutes, to the person next door conversing non-stop, and girls (assume they work there?) giggling, it was super annoying and not at all relaxing.\n- Due to noise, I was not able to relax or enjoy the session, except a brief 10-minutes at the start.\n- Minor, but no place in the room to place your clothes / belongings (e.g. basket or ledge).\n\nI guess if you brought noise cancelling headphones this place might be ok.\n\n",

I\u2019ve had many foot massages since emigrating to SG from Europe but this was by far the most attentive, relaxing and totally enjoyable....thank you CAT!! \u2763\ufe0f Already looking forward to my next visit with you.\nLoved how all the staff said hello as I sat on my chair...attention to detail peeps!!  This is how it\u2019s done \ud83e\udd47\n\n",
