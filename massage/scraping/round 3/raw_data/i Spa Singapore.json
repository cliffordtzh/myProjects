        "Chris Chan\nLocal Guide\u00b751 reviews\u00b735 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\n86 for a warm oil full body, done by malay lady. Ok, not bad, not as painful as some China therapists. Calf massage is excellent. Shoulders not as experienced, maybe tired from day. Clean.\n\n",

        "Sanjeev Kumar Gupta\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nOne of the worst experience my wife and me have ever had in our 20 years of SPA visiting. Uninterested and untrained massuers, who shockingly fell asleep during massage. Had to be woken up time and again. Pressed the tail bone and other muscles in the wrong places, causing severe pain that is sure to last for more than three days. It's peaking a day after the massage already..\n\nNot worth even one star. Clearly the other good reviews seem to be either internal our sponsored. Must avoid at any cost..\n\nWasted our health, time and money..\n\nSaw your response, and thanks for correcting us. Hope you can do something about your service too. The masseur sleeping off during the massage is not acceptable. Suddenly waking up and trying to catch up on the massage is what is causing us the pain now.\n\n",

        "Tony Loh\n6 reviews\u00b711 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMade an online booking n received an email too. Appointment is only confirmed after receptionist called. But not often they call back. I got the masseuse I booked online. Very happy!\n\nBut once when about to start, receptionist mentioned my appointment with her is not confirmed as they didn\u2019t call me. So I got another whom I\u2019m not...disappointment a little.\n\nFew days ago booked online again for this masseuse for today 12noon. But receptionist called me exactly 12noon today. I said \u2018sorry, I can\u2019t make it oredi\u2019\nI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s like so. Maybe overlook online bookings or busy everyday? I think I\u2019ll call in and book a slot next time...maybe better.\n\nBelow are my report done a while ago...\n\nParking is of abundance. Just minutes from MRT on foot. The setting is cozy n dimly lighted. There is a reception area for customers to sit n relax while waiting. Mine was an individual room with sliding door. My room has an attach shower place. But not sure why the room I\u2019m in is a little warm. A proper massage bed n some hangers/hooks for your clothings. Room is quite small but yet sufficiently big to move around. Got two sets of towels to shower b4 n after. Bath with warm or cold water as u wish. Soft background music is playing to lift up the atmosphere. My masseuse is a Thai lady, Miss V. She has amazing skill of relieving my body ache n send soothing feeling to my whole being. She was politely asking me if the pressure is ok with me. We also chatted causally n she communicated well in good spoken English. Think this going to be my regular relaxing MP.\nDo try them out...and enjoy...\n\n",
