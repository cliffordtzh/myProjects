        "Calvin Goh\n39 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nBeen a long time patron of this outlet but today was totally disappointed with the service staff i believe her name is yuki. Sent a what app msg as per usual practice to book a session but was queried on detail duration of the massage of which i had provided as per usual standard booking request. Very annoyed thereafter no reply for more than a hour n when i again asked she said done?? i ask her why she did not reply n confirm she just said not her but her colleague?? i told her this is not the service std as in the past whether the therapist we ask for is or not available we always get a quick reply as we can then plan or reschedule our time. She just said thank u for yr feedback n conversation with her abruptly ended by her!!! i am amazed by her action!!!\n\n",

        "Jervis Ching\n6 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nI asked them whether they are TCM registered so that I can claim the charges and they have confirmed twice that they are. But eventually they are not Singapore TCM registered and I whatsapp them with the screenshot and they never responded to me. Despite their poor knowledge and understanding of their business nature, the masseur is skillful though.\nWon't recommend if you need to claim the charges from insurance.\n\n",

Masseurs are well-trained and are ever so attentive to your needs (you can tell them where to focus on, eg tired necks). I usually try to politely reject signing up for a package but I had to proactively enquire for a package after my first treatment. You get $50 extra credits when you buy $500 (essentially 10% off each session).\n\n",
