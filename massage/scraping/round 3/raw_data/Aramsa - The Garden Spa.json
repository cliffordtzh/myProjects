They are so friendly and professional. Yvonne who massage me, make me feel so comfy. The strength she used it just nice and I enjoy the whole session. I felt so relax and light after the session too! I will ask my husband to bring me back again!\n\n",
        "N I\n2 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMy first visit to Aramsa spa was many years ago, and i remember it being a wonderful experience. Did a spa treatment recently, that comprises of a massage, scrub and floral milk bath. Nur was my massage therapist. She was professional and friendly throughout the treatment. She knew when to give quiet time when I was doing my massage, and also engaged me in friendly banter. She got the pressure points just right for my massage and made sure i was comfortable throughout my treatment. The floral milk bath was a highlight, where you get to soak amidst a garden-like surrounding. A wonderful experience indeed. I will definitely return for more spa treatments :)\n\n",

She is super welcoming and hospitable and made me feel at home. In terms of massage, she was very meticulous and takes it slow. She was not rushing at all, which I LOVE! She takes care of my entire body, including my head - all with the right amount of pressure. I enjoyed every minute of the session!\n\n",

We had 90 mins massage .\nThe bed is heated .\nThe room is located in the middle of the garden , we can hear bird chipping which is really lovely .\nThe room smells really nice , brought us back to the spa in Bintan or Bali .\nThe music is super relaxing .\nWe signed the package immediately after our first experience . Which is really good deal .\nOne comment though, it will be great if they can serve a nice ginger honey water etc after the massage .\nI would say compare to Natureland, it is heaven (this one ) and hell (Natureland) .\n\n",
        "San Wong\n2 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nMy friend and I were assigned to Pat and Sally, who were both two amazing ladies. We enjoyed our 1 hour weekday promo massage in a couple room. The techniques were good and we felt like we were in Bali! Ambience and music were great too.\n\nCould be better - The company/reception should check if there\u2019s any allergies to the massage oil used, be it the customer or masseuse. After the massage was completed and changed out, we were asked right away if we could do a Google review and I felt like I needed to do it on the spot. I think it should be asked by the receptionist instead after we make payment.\n\n",

We were touched by their sweet gesture of decorating the room to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We absolutely enjoyed their massage - very thorough and soothing with the right amount of pressure to ease our aches and tiredness away. They are truly professionals in their trade.\n\nNot forgetting the staff members we met in Aramsa, thank you for your hospitality and warmth. Our time with you has made this special day more special. Thank you!\n\n",

Rena was very professional and diligent and made sure I was comfortable throughout the session. My back is extremely tight and she spent lots of time trying to get all the knots out to help me feel better. The treatment overall is pure heaven - highly recommend it. I will definitely be back!

We had the racial harmony package and was attended to by Jane and Eileen. They even decorated the room so nicely!! Very thoughtful, therapeutic and soothing massage. We\u2019ll be back in the very near future. Thank you Jane and Eileen and Aramsa Spa!\n\n",

        "David Oon\nLocal Guide\u00b7146 reviews\u00b7678 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBy far, my favourite spa in Singapore. And for the longest time too. Was first introduced by a friend back in 2008 to this resort-like get-away, tucked in the serenity and greeneries of Bishan Park, away from the hustle and bustle of city life. And we have not stopped returning since then.\n\nWhat exactly made me and my missus a long time fan, is none other than the warm hospitality, professionalism, attention to details of the skilful masseuses and counter staff. Special mention goes out to our regular masseuses, Jane Lim, Hani, Jan Toh, and others who has since retired or returned to their home country.\n\nWe are in good shape right now, it is by no small part, thanks to your constant care and advise for a healthier and happy life.\n\nAnd kudos too to the counter staff for your warm welcome, each time we head down for our appointment.\n\nTo the management, keep up the great job, retaining talents and keeping the spa in good shape all these years.\n\n",
        "Tsui Ping Ong\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSpecially love the garden feel of this spa, that brings about a lot of peace and serenity before and after the treatment. I had the Bali Getaway treatment which was just nice in terms of duration and the massage was really relaxing. My therapist, Jen- was firm with her massage techniques and also very thoughtful during the session. As it was raining outside during my hot tub soak, she made sure the flooring was covered with towels to prevent me from slipping. The sounds of the rain really brought another level of peace and calming effect, and made me feel like I was really away in Bali. I totally enjoyed my experience at Aramsa, and hope to go back again soon.\n\n",
        "Pamela Koh\n7 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nRena and Tracy were both amazing - great massages!! the whole experience was wonderful and def worth a visit. Ambience was lovely too - doesn\u2019t feel like you are in SG!\n\n",
        "NOOR OMAIRAH\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had a delightful time at Aramsa. The staff was very welcoming. I was served by Yvonne, an experienced masseuse. She was delicate and respectful. She didn't chat throughout my massage so I had a peaceful and relaxing session :)\n\nWould definitely return to try other services!\n\n",
        "carrine seo\n3 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI walked in and was lucky to be able to arrange for a aroma rich massage in an hour\u2019s time. There\u2019s weekday promo now. It started off with a warm foot bath. The foot bath comes with salt and it\u2019s just a quick foot wash honestly. Ann Tan was like a motherly therapist, she was very chatty throughout the whole treatment which kinda wear me out cos I just want to relax and sleep. She knows where my blocked points are in the upper shoulders and apply the right pressure. It\u2019s disappointing the sauna and shower facilities can\u2019t be used during covid! She\u2019s also kind enough to show me some of the other outdoor bath rooms, they are beautiful! The whole experience takes me back to Bali. 1 point off because it seems like I have to give a review on the spot.\n\n",
        "Matilda Chua\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI just went to Aramsa this afternoon for their Matcha Green Tea scrub and massage package. My masseuse was Pat and she was lovely. From the beginning she was very attentive of my needs and of prior injuries I had and took a lot of care to make sure to check in with me throughout the scrub and massage to make sure I was comfortable. I would definitely recommend this package to anyone looking for a relaxing experience and ask for Pat!\n\n",
        "Li Wanshu\n1 review\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThere's something about being at one with nature that instantly calms your mind, body and soul. Hence, the concept of having spa in a garden compelled me to try out Aramsa at least once especially when I needed a short getaway from the daily hustle and bustle.\n\nWhen I reached Aramsa, the warmth and hospitality of staff really impressed me. I enjoyed every moment of my experience from start to finish. My masseuse was Jen and she was the sweetest person ever. I had really bad blisters on both feet that day and she went through the trouble of getting plasters for me without me even asking for it. \u2665\ufe0f\n\nThe massage was super shiok. Jen would adjust her pressure according to my body conditions and focus on the areas that were more tense e.g. neck, shoulders and glutes. I felt so much lighter and genuinely happier after the session.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Aramsa and would definitely come back for another relaxing session.\n\n",
        "Stephanie Lau\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had a great experience on my first time at Aramsa with a 150-minute Racial Harmony Spa treatment. The environment and ambiance of the place was very peaceful, like I\u2019ve been transported to somewhere exotic. My therapist Yvonne was attentive and comprehensive with the treatment. It was a great afternoon of relaxation.\n\n",

        "Rose rez\n6 reviews\u00b77 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nNow where do I even start... when I came I was greeted by a friendly staff and introduced me to the oils. I choosed mine and I was ushered to the waiting room. I was surprised as there isnt any promoting of other products( for me if there is, it will definitely be a major turn off) Im thn greeted by Marlia and proceeded to the room. I simply love the ambiance. I did the weekday promotion. When Marlia started to work with her magic hands i just simple knew she is someone with experience. I did the scrub first. The massage hasnt even started but i felt soooo relax. I was asked to take a shower and the outdoor area which feels like im in bintan! And my massage started. The pressure was on point. I felt some parts of my a lil strain but marloa seems to pick that up and she work on that part firm but gentle. I loved it when a warm weight was placed on my back and tummy when she moved to elsewhere. I could feel her calm energy which makes me relax. Like how sporean say.. \" syiok lah!!\" I will definitely return and perhaps Aramsa will be the only place i pampered myself. Thank you Aramspa and of course Marlia. Much love\n\n",
        "Aimee Cruz\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI booked the Himalayan Rejuvenation package for my husband and I. For someone who is not fond of massages (unpopular opinion), the experience was a lovely surprise. Wendy and Fion, our therapists were amazing!!! I usually can't wait for my session to finish but this two-hour session at Aramsa was not enough for me. My husband was also thinking of when to come back next. The hot stone massage was truly nice. The ambience is lovely and made us feel like we are somewhere not in Sg. This was our first massage since the pandemic started and if you're planning to have one, I truly recommend coming here. The only thing that I hope they will do is serve some nice tea in the waiting area. But overall, our experience was great!\n\n",
        "Grace Lry\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nPat and Wendy were really good at their job - service and massage. I enjoyed my session with them. Would have been been better without having to wear mask however it\u2019s understandable cos it\u2019s due to covid and good that Aramsa follows the restrictions \ud83d\ude01\n\n",

The ambience was fantastic and it was nice to have a view of nature while being massaged. Clean towels and good supply of masks and disposable undergarments. My wife even fell asleep during the massage! It was so comfortable. Love the hot stones. The heat helped my muscles to relax and certain 'knots' on my shoulders to be loosened. Highly recommend the hot stones treatment!\n\n",

        "Shiying Seow\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI had the loveliest afternoon here with my mother. I decided to treat my mom to the aromatherapy rich treatment here for her birthday and had the Inner Respite (Deep Tissue Massage) treatment for myself, and the experience was great from the start. They communicated the service to us & had a wide selection of aromatherapy oils for my mother to choose from. Claudine attended to my mother & spoke comfortably to her in mandarin, making sure that her every need was met & that it was a comfortable experience for my mother throughout. When my mom requested to change her oils just before the start of the session, Claudine still went out of her way to make the change for her. Rena was my therapist and explained to me the different tensions in my body and applied the perfect amount of pressure to relieve the stress in my body. She was constantly making sure that my body was responding positively to the treatment and made sure I was relaxed and comfortable throughout. The environment was clean, calming, peaceful and so professional. No hard selling at all throughout & will definitely be back here again - whether it is for a treatment or a special occasion. Definitely worth the price and visit. :)\n\n",

Very quiet and the rooms were clean and gave a resort feel with trees surrounding. Keep a lookout for the promotions they run, usually value for money.\n\nOverall a great experience and one of the better spas around. Would definitely come back again.\n\n",
        "Madihah M\n1 review\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nWent on 2 Dec for the weekday promotion: inner respite. Was received well at the reception area and given a questionnaire to fill up.\n\nAbsolutely loved the massage done by therapist Stephanie. Definitely an expert in the field; she could tell all my 'hard'/tense points and managed to relieve the tension.\n\nThe only parts I didn't like were: 1. the noisy lounge area; a group of non-locals were conversing loudly and taking photos while I was waiting to go to my room. I'd prefer a quieter environment which is soothing/relaxing, 2. The relatively thin walls; I could hear a man talking on his phone for a great length of time in the park as i was being massaged. Perhaps music can be louder.\n\n",

        "Michele Seah\n5 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nMy husband and a friend of mine all went to Aramsa Spa for a Sunday massage in late November 2021. Overall, the experience was pleasant and lovely. Chole and Pat were very professional as my husband's and my therapy massage consultants. However, we would have appreciated if we could be consulted with the types of massage oils for selection because I had a minor itchy skin reaction a couple of hours after our massage therapy. Perhaps a hypoallergenic oil may be best for the next massage therapy for customers with sensitive skin. Overall, we will be returning customers.\n\n",
        "Donna Al-Bu-Saidi\n6 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI recently left Singapore after 2.5 years however, just before I left, I was lucky enough to visit Arasma Spa. My Best Friend had bought me a gift voucher for my 40th Birthday & so before I left, I wanted to put it to use after spending weeks packing up boxes. Initially when I called, there was no space for me before I left as the place was fully booked (completely understand why now). I was really disappointed & explained to the receptionist I was leaving. I'd prepared myself for having to sell the voucher however, she did everything she could to move things around & found me a slot.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was blown away. The Spa is in the middle of a park surrounded by nature & is incredibly tranquil. The rooms are amazing & you have your own little suite essentially with a garden bath. My Therapist was Hani & she was excellent. She really made me feel special & I enjoyed every moment. I am so happy that the wonderful receptionist found me a slot because it really was just a wonderful experience. I also ended up buying the shower gel they have in the guest rooms because it smelt SO DAMN GOOD. I would definitely recommend for those looking for some 'me time' & a good pampering.\n\n",

        "Allison Joyce\n6 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery lovely place to go for an evening spa! Extremely accommodating and helpful, especially online when I was booking in for an appointment. Was a little over the place with my changing dates and lots of questions, but they were answered and met at every go. Staff was friendly and patient when my partner and I arrived and Claudine and Sand, whom were our masseurs, were very kind. Clear guidance in how the session was going to proceed and a consistent assurance of our well-being. Claudine hit all the tense spots of my back, so if you're looking for a masseuse who has strong hands but won't hurt you, you know who to ask for! Very clean place, excellent service from start to finish. Would come back again.\n\n",

What a great massage experience, thanks to my therapist Eileen who took great care, from the moment I stepped in to the warm ginger tea at the tea room after the session. Did I mention the hot compress pillows and calming tune with \ud83d\udc26 chirpings in the background.\n\nHighly recommended if you need to get away from it all during this time. Call them well in advanced and come experience this little piece of nature.\n\n",
