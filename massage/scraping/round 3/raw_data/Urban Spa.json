        "L P\n12 reviews\u00b74 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWhere shall I start? Jenny\u2019s (the owner) hospitality is second to none other. She not only provides a service based on your needs but also provides guidance and food the soul in wisdom, kindness and recommendations. I chose Urban Spa based on the reviews and I am not disappointed. Coco was my therapist. She was very attentive, applied the perfect amount of pressure and spent an excellent amount of time on my most tense areas. They even offered me ginger tea, dessert and water after the treatment. If you are ever in the area I highly recommend Urban Spa. Thank you ladies!!!\n\n",
        "Lim Ferlyna\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI love how everything was explained nicely to us before the start of our massage. From the types of massages they offered to the smell of the essential oils and scrubs. Got to give it to my massuer Winter for being attentive and gentle yet strength applied on point at the same time (told them beforehand that my pain tolerance is very low).\nMostly importantly, no hard selling at all. Smart move because they know that customers will be back again if they are satisfied with their service.\nWent on Christmas day and they even had a small deco in the couple room to welcome us! Thank you lady boss Jenny and team for the warm hospitality :)\n\n",

        "Victor Lum\n3 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nCame by for a couple massage with my wife for her birthday and really enjoyed the session.\n- The team is very professional and hospitable. Jenny (the spa owner I believe) took the time to sit down with us and go through the various massage options including types of massage, focus areas, usage of oils. She even demonstrates the level of pressure which is very useful to help customers decide!\nAny administrative requirements (eg providing ID) were clearly explained which really showed professional due diligence.\nOur masseurs were Elva and Coco, who were very pleasant and responsive to our physical cues to ensure that our massage was a comfortable experience.\n- The interior/facilities may not be the most posh/up to date, however it's clear that there is a lot of pride in keeping the premises clean and well maintained. Blankets/towels all smelt fresh and I was very pleasantly surprised while using the male washroom, which was spotless.\n- Finally, what really ties it all together are all the little touches:\nThere was some cute decor done to celebrate my wife's birthday\nWarm water/hot ginger tea promptly served before/after the massage\nBeds are heated/warmed and the customer is always kept cosy with warm towels and blankets.\n\n",

They are all polite, each have their own unique techniques. We like them all, but it still depends alot on personal preference. Have to try to know.

Can feel her love for people and passion for massage    Will definitely come back again. Thank you \u2764\n\n",

She found my friend and I slots for an hour's massage each, despite it being a busy Saturday night. She also proceeded to send me very precise photo directions to the spa. The spa is extremely clean and sanitary, with rooms that come with en-suite shower. The therapist who attended to me was very attentive to the pain points on my body. Quality is assured and I'll definitely be back for their other services!\n\n",

        "David Tay\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent for a massage treatment at Urban Spa on 9 November 2020 and I was really blown away by their fantastic service and warm hospitality from both staff and boss. From my booking to the actual consultation, the entire process with Urban Spa was hassle free. Their foot reflexology with back massage was very professional, extremely soothing and therapeutic. After a good massage, I was served with good ginger tea and local desserts such as green bean soup which is healthy and enriching. The spa facility is extremely clean and well maintained. As a first time customer, the promotion prices were very attractive and affordable. Special thanks and appreciation to Jenny who was very friendly, passionate and informative about various spa/massage knowledge. A very underrated spa I would say. There should be more hype and many people talking about it! Will definitely come back again with friends and family in the near future! Highly recommended. Keep up with the great services. Thank you :)\n\n",
        "Anna Yeo\n13 reviews\u00b72 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVery polite and service oriented spa but some aspects made me minus 1 star - kept rushing us to change and whether we wanna bathe after massage cos they were rushing to clear the room for the next couple... i think they shld have put more buffer time when scheduling guests. Also, my masseuse was inconsistent in pressure, oftentimes rubbing oil on my limbs many times... she didnt massage my Toes and Fingers too!!! While the other masseuse did it for my partner... so inconsistent. She tried to unknot some knots several times to no avail and finally pressed real hard and then moved on to other areas. Hmmm could have given slightly more effort there.\nFor the price I would say its okay. Comes with ginger tea and a chinese dessert at the end! $120 for 2 pax 1 hour. Good to try out! U may like it!\n\n",

The receptionist was extremely patient with the numerous phone calls I make and the staffs were all very welcoming when I arrived on short notice . The spa owner , Jenny was the highlight of my spa experience. She was very enthusiastic when getting to know me and informative on various massage knowledge . Moreover,  the masseuse was very professional and attentive to the pressure she was applying on me . Overall, I would say their foot reflexology with back massage was very relaxing and  therapeutic!\n\n",

        "Sany D Poe\nLocal Guide\u00b744 reviews\u00b797 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nWent for the first time on the new year after our staycay. Quite impressive greetings and able to arrange suitable time. Also each customer will be given a piece of form and asked on requested focus area to concentrate on.\n\nThe foot massage was okay but not the best because regardless of informing them on the form that I prefer more focus on my calf, not much time were spent there. More time were spent on the feet itself. So, not sure if the information were passed down or customer need to say it again. Which would be redundant.\n\nCan't recall much about my body massage because I was too hung up on how my foot massage was.\n\nAlso were asked if I wanted dessert but I left without having it because it was not served. Meh.\n\nPlace has a smoking room while waiting for your turn.\n\nOverall, it's just okay. Not too sure if it's worth recommending though. Perhaps you might want to reiterate about what goes on the form.\n\n",

We chose 90mins swedish massage and i can say that the massage was nice but rushing at the same time. We didn\u2019t bother that much but thought of giving a feedback to them for improvement.\n\nA guy came and i assumed its their boss and we gave our feedback but it seems that he just didn\u2019t want to listen to us and walked off just like that. It\u2019s unacceptable to treat a customer rudely. Upset with the overall and definitely won\u2019t comeback again\n\n",

        "Gaeul Lee\n5 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nSuper friendly staffs who always look for feedback to improve, even though it was a so great service! The lady who brought us in made us feel at home straightaway. Definitely want to comeback, and the price was very reasonable too.\n\n",
        "Dinie Jamz\nLocal Guide\u00b783 reviews\u00b742 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nIt was a good first experience. However, it would be great if they had followed through on the 'survey' 'questions' that were asked upon arrival. Mentioned a specific area that needed focusing but during massage, it wasn't followed through. At the end of massage, they offered dessert and drinks, opted for it, yet none was given so I just left. Lol\n\n",
        "Zing Yang\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat attentive massage by Coco, nice strength with warm ginger tea served before and after the massage. Also love the dessert soup at the end - ours was red bean soup and it changes daily.\n\n",
        "Hannah Tan\n10 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nAmazing experience at this shop nestled in Excelsior Tower (make sure you pass BOTH the hotel and Excelsior Shopping Centre to get there; googlemaps has their info wrong). The place is in a old building but it has a nice spa ambience that is most importantly, kept pristine and in great condition. The staff are friendly and my therapist, Winter, was brilliant. She was professional, and meticulous as well as check up on me if the pressure was to my liking.\nThe cherry on top was that they don't incessantly try to sell you packages and disrupt your experience because they don't do packages! They work off a loyalty system where you buy your sessions as you visit and they reward you after a certain number of visits with more sessions. It's perfect for people like me who are trying to stop buying packages that I don't use enough. Will definitely come again!\n\n",
        "CLARICE CHIA\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a very relaxing full body massage with a scrub. One of the best massage places in singapore I\u2019ve been at. No hard selling at all... I wanted to get a package but they don\u2019t even have one! What a gem of a place urban spa is. Highly recommended!  Very clean, massage was professional and well worth the money. Will be back to try the facial!\n\n",

This establishment is really well managed, the service was excellent, the premises was spotlessly clean and most of all, the massage technique was really good too!

        "Ramya Viswanathan\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nmost definitely the worse massage ever received. i went home feeling very oily all over. im sure the masseuse was even falling asleep while giving me a head \"massage\" which was nothing close to a massage she was petting my head. other than the back, no effort and strength was put into the legs, arms , head for sure. also, they did the back srub first instead of last. front counter very friendly and not pushy. but overall not even worth the $30 spent as fave voucher. i dont understand why there are so many good reviews here. and fave doesnt show the bad reviews..\n\n",
