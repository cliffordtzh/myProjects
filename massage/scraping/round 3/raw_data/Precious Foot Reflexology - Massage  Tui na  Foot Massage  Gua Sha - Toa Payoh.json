        "hakasson\n3 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt's my very first massage experience here. I was warmly welcomed by a friendly and spontenous lady, introduced herself as Linda.  Front desk counter linda is professional, prompt and quick to attend to customers. Even though the place is almost full, she is very professional, always carry a smiling face. The Chinese massue did an awesome job! Had a 2 hour body massage with Sandalwood Essential Oil. Massaue's techniques are really excellent. Room is clean and tidy with soothing music. Definitely will return for massage again!\n\n",
        "Guay Gen Phua\n5 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent there first time after seeing some good reviews and did not disappoint! Jackson was explaining in detail the different parts of foot massage linking to the bdifferent body parts. He's very skilled and did not\njust use brute forces like some other massage place. No hard sell, will recommend! Thanks for the great massage!\n\n",
        "Natalie Tay\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nChanced upon this gem on google and requested for Jackson due to the many good reviews here. On my first visit, my main concern was to resolve my excruciating daily migraine which recently worsened. 1 week later, my migraine is almost 90 percent cured. Today was my second visit and I opted for the 2 hour body therapy addon 0.5 hrs to slim my bloated and protruding tummy due to stagnated qi and water. And to my astonishment, he managed to flatten my tummy significantly within half an hour. It has never been so flat in 2 years! Another thing which amazes me is that he is able to pinpoint and target problem areas instantly, instead of the systematic steps (123, abc) monotonous massages offered in many other places.\n\n",

        "Bell Flower\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nIt was the worst massage I ever encountered theres ' The lady masseur does not have any technique. The pressure used was wrong, and she pinched the calf instead of pressing on them .  She doesn\u2019t have any idea what she\u2019s doing. My legs felt much more painful after visiting them. It\u2019s unfair n unethical for the shop to send an untrained masseur just cos they are busy yet want business. Disappointed \ud83d\ude21\n\n",
        "Edward Lee W Y\n3 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nMasseurs are good. problem is the counter staff who is quite absent minded and in conflict with the masseurs sometimes which ruins the massage experience. Hard to get appointment slots from the counter lady wearing specs.\n\n",

        "Syafiqah Suhaimi\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWent over a few days ago! I was searching on Google the best reflexology place nearby. I somehow injured my foot and was unwell for two weeks, had to take a lot of medicine, on bed rest for 7 days and went to the doctor 3 times.. so I finally decided to go for a foot massage to see if it would help. It has been a few days after the massage and amazingly my foot has recovered like 90%! I would like to thank Jackson so much for attending to my needs and making sure that I will heal faster and better :) He definitely knows his forte! I recommend you to ask for Jackson when you come over/or make an appointment as he really takes care of the client. He also knew the problem as soon as he started the massage. Turns out I'm just very dehydrated and also overweight haha! I really have him to thank as if it wasn't for him I would still be on MC. Didn't have any cash on me to give tips but I'll be sure to give some the next time I'm there :) Thanks so much, he's a keeper, I hope you'll give him a raise! (Went to the TPY Outlet)\n\n",

He really focused on the pain points of my feet, and spent time to fix them. Really rare for any reflexology session, which is usually more of an overall comforting massage.

I saw a lot of good reviews and decided to try out their Message skill.\n1) no hygiene\n2)They actually put on gloves to help me massage, you know that feeling is very uncomfortable\n\nI\u2019m have quite bad experience with them and I really don\u2019t know why they have so many good reviews. I\u2019m not a fussy person And I Message at least once a week when I mentioned no hygiene means the environment is really kinda below the expectations, the towel have smell and not sure the towel is reuse or not , that kind of hygiene level I meant.\n\nMaybe there is some other good messuer but for me , my first visit is quite disappointing.\n\n",

He is very skilful and capable in fixing my sprains from sport injuries/ backache. My weekly \"servicing\" by him allows me to continue playing my favourite sport. Jeffrey from Toa Payoh branch is really an asset to your organisation. He always aims to perfectly solve customers' sprains/ aching problems and he wont burge to give sloppy massage as he has a reputation to upkeep. Very professional instead! I have been going to the Toa Payoh branch for a few years and recommending my volleyball friends (at least 30+) to him too. Keep up the excellent service!\n\n",
