Especially when you book the right massue. You will feel at ease. The tiredness gone. Ache and discomfort suddenly gone. I have visited the place several times. But today, I finally managed to book the right massue. Her name is Aira. Looks n figure not important. She is a simple gal having good hands/fingers.The way she massage. The pressure point techniques. I really really enjoy the massage done by her... She really knows how to apply the firmness during massages. She is friendly too. I gave her 5 star. Fully recommended. Great job Aira. I will visit the place again and book her again and again n again as long she is working there. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n",
