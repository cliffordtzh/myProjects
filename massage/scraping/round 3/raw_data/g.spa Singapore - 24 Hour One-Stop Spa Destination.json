I very much enjoy my 60mins massage for the entire experience.\n*Do take note For FEMALE*that come here u don need to bring ur swimsuit they will provide disposable kind of inner wear, shampoo & conditioner is also provided. There\u2019s two dressing table for u to put ur make up on and a hairdryer to dry ur hair after shower, don\u2019t forget to bring makeup remover if u have make up on, while I was putting my makeup on there\u2019s few of the girls forgot to bring their makeup remover , other than that they are well taken care of the female side.\nFor the cafe wise food was ok don expect too much cause is a buffet kind eat all u want ,do try their chicken rice and curry with bread. There\u2019s one guy in black I think is the manager at the cafe very much helpful and good customer, however there\u2019s this young guy and aunty in grey very rude. Is just few table there they like cannot handle the crowd. Imagine people come here enjoy then get turn off by their attitude but thankfully the one that managed the cafe is nice. Price for 2pax was $140++ is very reasonable.\n\n",

Crowd control is needed as the spa has been really full ever since the start of covid19, even on weekdays. And with the distancing, you most likely need to wait for a seat at the sofa, spa and dining area.\n\n",

        "Sherman Guo\nLocal Guide\u00b781 reviews\u00b7544 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe place where I dreamed long to go and is affordable! Their staff are very friendly and provide wonderful service. The food is above good with variety to choose from.\n\nI stayed for 19 hours. Checked in at evening till next day lunch.\nIt would be even better if the temperature of their hot and cold pool be more friendly : )\n\nAll in all, they made you felt like you are a VIP there!\n\nI shall visit there again\n\n",
        "Gijsson Chow\nLocal Guide\u00b730 reviews\u00b725 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nNice that they open 24hours. Food is not bad considering it's free flow. Massage I had was one of the best I had in my life. The masseur auntie''s name is Amy. 4 stars because massage price was steep even after member's discount.\n\n",
        "ysl\nLocal Guide\u00b766 reviews\u00b7150 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nCame for the 1 for 1 promo which included a 90min massage + 24 hours access to facilities.\n\nOverall pleasant experience, massage was good and solid though room was not exactly sound proof. Masseur technique was good and definitely professional, no chit chatting etc.\n\nMale had more facilities vs women\u2019s, with a sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and cold bath.\n\nVisited on a Saturday and place was not so packed with proper crowd control, thus better to call / book before heading down.\n\nFood was free flow with a somewhat limited menu, had couple of misses but nothing that was too terrible to be consumed, overall no complains for a day trip out.\n\nBetter suited for double dates or groups as facilities are split by gender. All in all, still recommended and feel free to stay 24 hours given they have a \u201csleeping\u201d area!\n\n",
        "Alvin Then\nLocal Guide\u00b719 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nGood place for a small staycation..facilities abit dated and worned out but overall still quite good experience\n\n",
        "Zhihai Ng\nLocal Guide\u00b788 reviews\u00b72,461 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nLocated at level 2,the long entrance to the lobby give you a smooth and relaxing ambient, the dark light make your mind relax and no window inside the area make your forgot about the time , choose to dine to chat and relax and chill with friend, 24 hour usage of facilities in the sauna, steam room, hot and cold jacuzzi. There a  also the lounge area to rest and recharge. Staff was friendly and helpful. There various massage  package to choose from as well.\n\n",
        "Clifford Ng\n1 review\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nDespite being a g.spa regular and have been returning frequently today is my worse experience in g.spa. The cafeteria is a buffet concept but doesn't allow us to order more chicken wings. All the staffs just simply brush us off by saying that the chef said that the chicken wings is part of the nasi lemak set. However I was here last week when they had the chicken rice set but they allowed us to order more Chicken on the set when we wanted more. I just do not understand why we can't order more chicken wings. It's not a expensive item.\n\n",
        "Heii Zell\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIt was my first time at Gspa and i would say that i had a really great experience!\n\nI got the Super Spa Experience package which was relatively affordable with a 60min full body massage, 40min foot massage and a 24h admission to all facilities at the spa for $163.\n\nThe facilities although abit old, is well maintained. The dining room with dishes from mains to small sides with hot or cold beverages. A sofa lounge where you can recline and relax and of course the jacuzzi and sauna!\n\nItems that you would need are stocked up, towels, disposable underwears, disposable combs, rubber bands, cotton buds are provided. Shampoo, body wash, conditioner as well as body lotion too.\n\nThe staff members were also really attentive and nice! Making sure that my partner and i were comfortable and had everything that we needed.\n\nMy takeaway from this would be to bring someone of the same gender with you to enjoy facilities together as most of the time aside from the general areas are segregated, which is a little lonely when you have no one to talk to in the jaccuzi haha.\n\nWould definitely recommend to friends and come back again!\n\n",
        "Lilian\n3 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThis was our first time at the g.spa. As a very first feeling, the facilities looked a bit outdated and old which could give maybe wrongly some unclean \u201cappearances\u201d.\n\nAs first time visitors, something we mentioned at the reception, we have not really been given any guidance or explanations on the spa rules. The changing clothes and shoes were at the end not fitting us (for example this was hard to climb the stairs to go to the couple room)\n\nWe had also booked a 1hour couple room with jacuzzi. Again, no one to really guide us at the end. Most importantly, there was no shower in this couple room. So not really convenient to remove all the foam and soap accumulated from the jacuzzi.\n\nIn addition, the staff indicated that the pictures with the decorations with mermaids for example are only on the men side. So ladies, don\u2019t expect your side to be as the one as you can see on the pictures.\n\nAt the end we were a bit disappointed and stayed only approximately 2hours knowing this is a 24hours spa.\n\n",
        "Darren Rhert\n10 reviews\u00b76 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nMassage js great. Food is good. And the recliners are changed to the better ones. The water smells slightly funny thou, would be nice if there are more maintenance since there are more people now.\n\n",
        "Shermaine Wee\nLocal Guide\u00b733 reviews\u00b784 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nMy husband paid for the 1 for 1 package in Nov and we just came at end of Feb to utilize it. The external of the building of Gspa is really old and run down. Overall feel of the area when you first step in is that it is really dim and need a refresh in their Reno. After a late lunch (with changing hot dishes menu everyday), we went off to our respective male and female hot bath area. The auntie there is friendly and show a newbie like me around. The hot bath area for females is on the 3rd floor (up a flight of stairs). It is really small and on a weekday afternoon it was not luckily not crowded and I get to use it after waiting for two groups to leave the hot bath. After 1hour plus, we assembled at dining area for our massage slots and off we go. The massage auntie is good and I enjoyed it. After 90 mins I went back to the dining area for dinner. Overall I don\u2019t think I can spend more than 6 hours there including the meals and massages even though we can spend up to 24 hours there. Facilities are quite small, food can be boring after two meals there and we can\u2019t rest with much privacy. Massages are quite good so that\u2019s their saving grace.\n\n",
        "wong liyang\nLocal Guide\u00b732 reviews\u00b714 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nI believe this might not be a good fit for people who prefer a quiet spa experience. Lots of water splashing by 2 different groups of people while I was there. Watching their shows on the phone or just talking very loudly in general with disregard of others.\n\nThough I arrived at ard 1030pm and recognise spa pools are only cleaned at 3-4am, the water had a distinct smell which lingers on top of the usual scent of chlorine. I would not recommend this place if you're interested in a pleasant and relaxing spa experience.\n\nThe relaxation lounge is much better though, with comfortable and dim settings. The food choice at night was mainly toasts, dim sums, and soup of the day with drinks. The custard bao was delicious according to my friend.  Perhaps the lunch/dinner menu is much more enticing, though I did not stay here long enough to try it out.\n\n",
        "Raquel\nLocal Guide\u00b719 reviews\u00b720 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nNo booking needed, just walked in. We came one sunday noon and leave next monday. Aunty in female fitting room very friendly and nice, always check with us and guide us to enjoy the steam room. Not crowded, maybe next day is working day. Sauna room too small and only occupied by one person, other ppl might need to queue for it. Food taste is not bad especially traditional kaya toast which make me homesick. Many rest chair TV have no signal and cannot fix, lucky got free wifi to watch own movie online. Midnight wil have someone walking around and pls expect can't sleep well. *Many uncles here*\n\n",
        "Ming Cheng\nLocal Guide\u00b7174 reviews\u00b7138 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nWent on a Sunday afternoon and there was quite a number of patrons, but I wouldn't say it was crowded. The place was beautiful, and the food (buffet style) was surprisingly good, both in terms of quality and variety. One gripe would be that I found the water way too hot.\n\n",
        "Abber Tan\nLocal Guide\u00b783 reviews\u00b778 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI only come here for the good massage by the masseuse here (which is what the 5 star is for) and reasonably good food it serves (limited selection due to heightened alert currently), the sauna room and hot steam room. That\u2019s all.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t use the shared men\u2019s pool due to confidence in hygiene matters, doing hygiene matters when the pool is only meant for soaking and dipping to relax. People talking loudly, or on their phone, or watching some videos with very loud music/ talking etc. I feel hygiene and spa rules can be further improved / regulated to make this place more appealing to the younger crowds. But I guess it has more or less been cultivated so it may offend old timers in the process.\n\nStill, I personally appreciate this concept of a spa + massage + resting + dining all in one, is quite nice actually, just that I guess over the years the regulars who come here are a typical group which may not fit well with the Gen Z and Gen Y group.\n\nWith the above said, the masseuses here are the better ones in Singapore. I hope it remains good like that and I will continue to visit.\n\nThe service staff here are also very tolerant and friendly and service-oriented group of people. For example, the receptionists, the Cafeteria lady who ensured I had my fill of food and drinks, and also not to forget the management who approved my expired credit (due to lock-down) to be utilized. Considering the overall experience, this place still deserves a 5 star for being one of its kind in Singapore.\n\n",

        "Eve Thow\nLocal Guide\u00b7301 reviews\u00b7489 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nExpensive, rigid system where all points must be used within 1 year..If not have to buy new package or pay $50 administration fee. The facilities also not very well maintained, the food standard has dropped tremendously as compared to I first joined 10 years ago\n\n",

        "K. W.\nLocal Guide\u00b725 reviews\u00b772 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nWhole spa centre consist mainly of individual treatment rooms (mostly not occupied?), common facilities like resting area is quite limited and small, always occupied by snoring and chatty middle aged man. Steam room, jacuzzi also small, not able to stay longer. Food is mediocre.\n\nGreat IF there is more different kinds of hot & cold pools and overall bigger space for common facility area.\n\n",
        "Rabbiatul Adawiyah\n7 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nQuite nice! Slightly expensive but more worth it if buy the membership. Muslimah friendly(?) - ladies and men separate area for facilities but massage area mixed. Uniforms go up to 5XL - So don't worry.\n\nSlight disappointment, my masseuse didn't crack my body, but still a nice experience :)\n\n",
        "Terrisa Tham\n9 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\n5 stars for all the services and environment.\n1 star for the reception.\nI have no idea how to rate for this.\nI first time came here,thinking to have a relaxing long weekend,and gspa is what we choose.\nOnce we entered here,we showed the booking QR code to the receptionist that we made online,and the receptionist named Ada Zhang told us that we didn't make reservation for massage. But there is no time available for us to book in the website. My bf said he called few times but no one answering the calls,she insist they \u201c\u80af\u5b9a\u201d have answer calls. What a funny thing is the customer checking in next to us interrupted \"I also called for many times,but no one answer my call.\" Attitude please be good,you're not only ruined the customers' mood, also the reputation of the company. We doesn't mean to blame anyone,but please behave yourself as a receptionist,the way she reply us is fxcking RUDE.\nBy the way,the services of all area are wonderful only except the reception.\n\n",
        "Eliza Ho\nLocal Guide\u00b7103 reviews\u00b7627 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nFoods were awesome for the price you paid for. Grilled salmon, grilled chicken thigh. Tuna sandwich was delicious with lightly toasted bread. However, facilities wise weren't much for female. 1 hot tub, 1 steam room and 1 extremely small sauna room that could barely fit in 2 person.\n\n",

The spa itself was very relaxing - wasnt crowded when we went there on a tuesday afternoon.

        "Kitty Paw\n2 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nits a very relaxing and enjoyable weekend getaway spot. The food is really above my expectation for free flow ala carte buffet menu, all the food are served hot and tasty. the resting lounge is surprisingly available for us 3 pax even on a weekend as i saw alot of reviews of overcrowding but it was a pleasant experience for my case. i was very lucky at some point time i was even able to have the whole jacuzzi hotpool and steam and sauna to myself so i manage to snap some photos or else you must get permission from other users if you want to take photos or video. for ladies spa facilities it has a jacuzzi hot pool (can fit 4 pax), steam room (maybe can fit 4 pax too) and a sauna room (strictly 1 pax or if you go with a friend and both are very slender maybe can fit 2). all the spa facilities is very relaxing I love it and I can use it 3 times in a visit and head down to the cafe for another meal again as you gets hungry easily after all the sweat from sauna and steam and jacuzzi hot pool. my husband described for me the man's spa facilities and it sounded like their's is way much nicer and cooler than the ladies'. it itches my heart to want to visit the male section too (just kidding\ud83d\ude01) i got a massage of gateway to vitality too for 60mins and its like an acupoint massage similar to tuina and you can request for softer or stronger massage. please make an appointment in advance especially for massage as weekend they are quite fast filled.you really feel resfreshed after the massage but some spots are achy after the acupoint massage as the masseur mentioned my certain muscles is very stiff. i could say you totally do not need to bring anyting except your ID , phone cable charger, sleeping eyemask, and your money for payment as this spa literally provides everything from disposable underwear, disposable bra, short pant and robe for when relaxing at the resting lounge. shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, hair band, shower cap, towels, hair dryer, comb, cotton bud, free flow drinks and foods and even blankets to use at resting lounge. i have worried for nothing as its my first time visiting a spa and i brought everything i could think of that i may needed and ended up just keeping it in the locker.\n\n",

        "Nanfeng Wang\nLocal Guide\u00b7109 reviews\u00b7446 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nThis place used to be good when we started coming 3years back but the standard has dropped a lot since then. We use to enjoy good food, massage and a comfortable environment!\n\nNow the food standard is poor. The kaya toast no longer taste good. The menu is mostly carbs and sometimes the fries are stale.\n\nThe massage varies. If we get someone who is good, its good but u need to request for it otherwise u will get someone who is unskilled or someone who massage for the sake of massaging.\n\nThe chairs use to be comfortable but it has been 3 years since we came and they didn't change the chair hence the leather has torn and cracked so now they used a towel to cover it instead.\n\n",

        "Dissa\nLocal Guide\u00b712 reviews\u00b732 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWe wanted to try the place for the first time as recommended by a friend so called around 11 pm to ask what time is next available slot and they said 12:15 am on the phone multiple times but when my bf arrived they said they confirmed 1:15 am so he cannot be accommodated. I hope they were just honest that they made a mistake but they insisted they confirmed 1:15. Very Poor customer service and disrespectful of time. If they cannot handle simple scheduling I suppose experience would have not been great either plus place looks shady and tacky.\n\n",
        "WW\nLocal Guide\u00b727 reviews\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nWorth it with their current 1 for 1 promo. Otherwise no. The massage was initially uncomfortable until the masseur rub on massage oil, then it was fine. Women's sauna is very small (can only sit two) and not hot at all. Cleanliness left more to be desired. Spa attendants were friendly. Food was okay, nothing fantastic, but okay.\n\n",

        "Yvonne Leow\n1 review\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nVisited the spa on 27 Sep (Sunday). Bought the 1 for 1 promotion, I think the price for it was worthy. With 24 hours amenities and cafe (you can order from their ala cart menu from 12pm to 1030pm), the rest of the time I think their steamer got bao; bun available.\n\nThe place was cozy, but feeling not so good due to the resting sofa was quite packed and end up we got no place to rest.. but we do ask a staff to assist us in finding two resting sofa for us.. so in general I think it was a little packed.. especially resting sofa,  and cafe during meal time.\n\nHope to see improvement.\n\nOverall still a Super good experience and a place to relax.\n\n",

        "Aamir Dhakan\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI had booked this place for a couple\u2019s massage for me and my wife. I had selected a particular massage at the time of booking. We were looking for a relaxing massage as opposed to a deep tissue massage. When we reached, we were told that the massage that we had booked ( g. Business class) was only a deep tissue massage. The website did not provide this information. It should\u2019ve been a simple task of asking the therapist to change the massage. But they didn\u2019t budge and were quite inflexible. Additionally, the place appeared super-commercial. A bad experience overal!\n\n",
        "Hui Peng Ong\n8 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nDecided to try out G.spa because of the 1 for 1 promo. Massage was great and the free food was surprisingly good. Also spent some time resting on their armchair there and it was really relaxing. The aunty there was also very helpful and showed us around the place when we were a little lost. Only thing some pple might feel uncomfortable about is that most of the areas are shared among both genders. You will be wrapped with nothing but a robe and some disposable bra and panty underneath. Other than that, the rest was a pleasant experience. The shower, soap and shampoo provided were also really nice smelling. Will definitely visit again if there is another promo.\n\n",

But the restaurant service is terrible and disappointed me. I order two chef's recommendation at around 3.40pm on 1st August. At around 4pm i saw there is two chef recommendation(chicken chop) coming out from the kitchen and the waiter served to other tables which came later than us. So i went to ask the waiter where is our food as it is been 20mins and we get reply is that the chicken chop is finished and ask us to get other food. Which meant she serve the last chef recommendation (chicken chop) which to be served to us and give to other table order much later then us. It was a terrible experience and becoz of this, i wont top up my package anymore. Faster use up all my credit and wont ever visit Gspa again. Absolutely bad service experience.\n\n",

        "Ronald Koh\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nCall up and booked a 60 mins gateway to vitality massage on 8 Feb and pay as a non member price of $155 (including use of spa facilities). Requested for a male therapist cos I want a strong massage. He was indeed strong but I didn't experience the kind of \"tension relief\" or \"Shiok\" reactions commonly associated with good massages. I think it has something to do with his skills and motion rhythm  connection. All in all I didn't feel better and at some instances it was kinda painful even. So it wasn't satisfactory to say the least. Not sure whether the receptionist kinda expected I won't be satisfied with the massage as they didn't even try to sell me a package. Promptly  gave me the bill for the massage,\n\nI won't mind going back to chill out at the spa facilities but realised I won't be able to utilise a Promo voucher which allows access the facilities for 24 hours at $53.50 as I'm not considered 1st customers now isn't it?\n\n",

You can nap on the sofa, eat all the food, drink all the drinks. And pick from a variety of massages to suit your mood.\n\nFor men, enjoy a hot soak and jacuzzi with your buddies. Then challenge each other to see who can last longer in the cold dip. Only the brave have stepped one foot, then the other into the cold pool.\n\nNot many have lived to tell the tale.\n\nActually during my visit there, I did see someone dip fully in. And I remember thinking to myself, what is the guy made of?\n\nService is good, no hard sell to get you to buy a prepaid arrangement so you can enjoy member rates.\n\n",

Bonus for small ice towels / ice bath making hot/cold routine very efficient and fun.\n\nWhere it lacks for me is the decor, and the food is... OK.
