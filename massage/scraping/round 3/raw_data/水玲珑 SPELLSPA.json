        "ChernZheng Poh\n3 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nThe place is nice and clean. Greeted by a warm smile from receptionist upon arrival, and not very hardsale on pushing their treatment services. Was assigned Julia for me, the therapist was very professional and detailed. She was paying attention on the pain points of my upper back and shoulder, and able to loosen my sore muscles after working out. Highly recommend her if you were looking for some professional massage skills. Had several relaxing experience, definitely will visit again. Thank you\n\n",
        "alan lim\n7 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nJust went this afternoon for a 1 hour massage at spell spa. Was allocated therapist Michelle. She was highly professional and have good massage skills. Managed to help me to loosen my sore back muscles. She is always paying close attention to my needs by asking if strength was enough. Will highly recommend her if you want a relaxing massage. She is a gem. The spa overall have a nice and clean ambience. Had a relaxing experience. Thank you.\n\n",

        "TAN JAY\nLocal Guide\u00b739 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI wanted to give 5 stars but too bad the lights in the room cannot be dimmed as I liked to nap during massage. Jenny from Vietnam wonderful skills although young but very experienced and caring asking about her strength and if you are in pain.i go for massage every week skipping around different shops and spas and I can say this shop will make me come back for more especially jenny as she don't really use her elbows which i really hate instead mostly using strength from her fingers.Will definitely come back again as I left a very satisfied man.Clean and professional place\n\n",
        "Albert Pang\n1 review\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nI am disgusted by all the positive comments provided.\nFirst of all, the receptionist will only recommend the most expensive package\nSecond, the therapist will just proceed with their normal routines, disregardess of what you had communicated, be it simply saying your calves and ankle need more attention.\n\nThey do not even offer  refunds, but to give a discount voucher. It is a shop that no one should even attempt to\n\n",
        "Charlie C\n5 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWalked in with no reservation for couples massage. They were able to get to us right away and charged a fair price. Spent $120 Singapore Dollars for the aromatherapy / essential oil massage - $60 per person for 60 minutes each.  Money well spent!\n\nNot only did it feel like it was longer than 60 minutes (in a good way) but it was one of the best massages we\u2019ve had in Southeast Asia. The masseuses and front desk receptionist were extremely friendly and helpful. They truly know what they are doing.\n\nWe are only in Singapore for 4 more days and will definitely be back before we leave for the states. Thanks again!\n\n",
