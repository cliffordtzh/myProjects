        "Bishmar Shan\n8 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nBest Massage I have had so far since I came here. My Masseuse was Jolin and she did an amazing job with her techniques.

        "Takehiro Miyai\n6 reviews\u00b73 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nRoom is clean and staff are friendly. Only wish that massage itself was great. It was not too bad but not great either. Just rubbing gently with oil is not a kind of massage I was looking for. Maybe I should have asked for firmer massage. Good luck\n\n",
        "Mike Alessi\nLocal Guide\u00b776 reviews\u00b7203 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nDefinitely NOT one of the better massages I\u2019ve had in Singapore. The masseuse spent the first 45 minutes of my 90-min session forcibly jabbing her elbows into my upper back. Far from relaxing and quite painful. Note to Kyoto staff, massaging via elbows is not comfortable for the  receiver. After that she then lightly massages my legs for 45 minutes without any real care or effort whatsoever. Left quite disappointed. Gave 2 stars for quality of facility.\n\n",
