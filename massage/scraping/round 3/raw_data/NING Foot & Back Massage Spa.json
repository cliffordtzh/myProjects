        "Alicia\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFirst time leaving review. first time visiting this spa. Spontaneous visit. Firm but relaxing 60 mins back and shoulder massage. Paid $72. They sanitised after each customer.\nI had a tight neck muscle on my left. Left the place with more relax shoulders. Only me and other customer on Thur late afternoon. They have lowered the price. Remember to refer to the printed copy pasted in front of counter as good. Copy on Google review is outdated.\nWill visit again.\n\n",
        "Sie Yen Ng\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDiscovered this gem at Jewel today. My masseuse, Irene, was super nice, friendly, working hard on all my knots, especially where I told her that I was feeling sore. The ambience was really relaxing and I could just sink into the very comfortable chair. Irene told me their business is very badly affected by the pandemic though. Do support them!\n\n",

        "Jas Pn\n9 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nLousy back and foot massage, feels like a back rub than massage. Therapists does not ask if the massage strength is ok or not. Don't feel any relief after the massage, will not visit again.\n\n",

        "Hermann Loy\nLocal Guide\u00b752 reviews\u00b7155 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad the 70min Foot and Back massage before my Long flight. Karen was my therapist and she did a amazing job of working out the knots. Flying, especially in economy Long haul puts a lot of pressure in the lumbar area so it was good to get some relief before another Long haul flight. Ambience and setting is nice.\n\n",

        "Olivier Le Sayec\n11 reviews\u00b712 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nHad an overpriced foot massage for 1 hour. The massage was average and they let you clean your feet by yourself at the begining of the session.\nI gave my card and realised that they have charged me $85 (or $10 more than advertised). I asked for rectification and got just $5 back.\nThey advertise $75 but have a hand written tiny note that say (exl of 7% gst).\nOverall, i felt ripped off by this massage place.\n\n",

        "Meli\n7 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nWe opted for the 100 minute massage today - the service is good. My therapist got rid of the tight knot at my back which I really appreciate. I'd recommend dropping by the place when you're in Jewel.\n\n",
        "Simin Liu\n6 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nWent for a foot spa and it an extremely poor experience. It was already strange at the start that we had to dry our own feet after the foot bath and the spa scrub was outright painful. Therapist did not pay attention to blisters or cuts on the feet and pulled the skin off a fresh blister. Would not return\n\n",
        "Angela Ng\nLocal Guide\u00b796 reviews\u00b762 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nShould have paid more attention to the reviews. Lots of 5 star reviews by people who only have one review on their profiles... \ud83d\ude12\n\nThere's only a single masseuse who doesn't seem to know what she's doing. Lots of pressing with thumbs on the same spots. I left feeling more sore than refreshed. Didn't seem to know how to adjust the chair properly either, which left me seated in an uncomfortable position.\n\n",
        "nur hafizah\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat foot reflexology done by Mary. The pressure is fantastic and the strokes of the massage was good. Recommended place to go for the quick fix for the tired feet!\n\n",
        "Avelyn Cho\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nLooking for a massage place with hubby and chances upon NING FOOT & BACK SPA. Chosen a 40 min back and shoulder massage, therapists are KATHERINE and KAREN. They are very professional, it was so comfortable and techniques used were great. Place is clean and music is soothing.\n\n",
        "Charli Mocon\n5 reviews\u00b71 photo\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nDecided to get the 60min shoulder and back massage despite it being a bit pricey. The chair wasn't adjusted properly and incredibly uncomfortable. The 'massage' was a back rub at best and gave me zero relief from the knots in my neck and shoulders.\nCouldn't wait for it to be over. Easily the worst massage I've ever had.\n\n",
        "michelle yow\nLocal Guide\u00b735 reviews\u00b743 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nGreat massage skills! Went in to get my very sore back and shoulders sorted and the therapist did not disappoint at all! She found every knot and sore point and after 40 minutes, my back felt so much 'lighter' and the soreness has completed disappeared. Highly recommend this spa joint\n\n",
        "Annie Cahill\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nIrene, Jason, and Katherine were truly wonderful. After months of living in a developing country under stressful circumstances, it was lovely to be brought back with a massage here. Irene was able to relieve a lot of stress and I feel great.\n\n",
        "Durga Sureshlal\n11 reviews\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nI visited in January this year before the Covid situation. Katherine gave me an amazing foot massage! She even helped focus on relieving the heel pain owing to Plantar Fasciitis which causes discomfort after my running sessions. It's been 5 months now and I have had little to no pain post the message therapy. Able to run worry- free now. Will definitely visit again.\n\n",
        "Judy Chiang\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nHad a great massage! The masseuse was very respectful and treated my back with care. I got relief from it! Would recommend anyone who needs a good relief before flying off from the airport. Got this done at the Jewel at Changi!\n\n",

        "joseph ng\n2 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nVery clean and peaceful environment to come for massage. Both Katherine and Karen skill is awesome. Fall asleep during massage. After the massage, feel more refreshing.\n\n",
        "justin\n7 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nExceptional foot massage for plantar fasciitis!\nI have problems with my arches that lead to debilitating heel pain that comes on if I have been walking a lot on hard concrete type surfaces, and was actually just looking for a general foot massage that I have had several times before at other reflexology places.\n\nI didn't have the pain at the time of the massage but thought I would ask if they knew anything about preventing heel pain through massage. To my surprise the masseuse (Agnes) questioned me further on my symptoms correctly identifying where and when the pain generally occured and the aggravating factors. It felt like a professional consultation (and I work in healthcare)!\n\nI opted for the 60min massage on the basis that they actually work up the foot and into the lower leg in this session, to allow enough time to see if Agnes could make any difference.\n\nThere's no denying that the massage was painful at times, but Agnes was able to modify the pressure accordingly and it was totally worth it as I could actually feel the muscles under my foot relax as the knot that she was pressing dispersed...if I could bring her back to London with me as my personal foot masseuse I would. Best foot massage I've had to date!\n\n",

Will definitely come back again for another session and maybe I can get rid of my pains for good.\n\n",

        "\u3059\u307f\u3059\n12 reviews\u00b75 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\n(Translated by Google) In the dive (Sunday evening) on the day, I waited for a while, but I also had the flexibility to massage. Back and shoulders in bed. The interior is dark and calm, but the bed facing the outside is a bit dazzling. But the massage was the best and the therapist was good. I would like to go back and forth before and after the flight if it is timed!\n\n(Original)\n\u5f53\u65e5\u98db\u3073\u8fbc\u307f\uff08\u65e5\u66dc\u5915\u65b9\uff09\u3067\u3001\u5c11\u3057\u5f85\u3061\u307e\u3057\u305f\u304c\u878d\u901a\u3082\u3057\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u3057\u3066\u3082\u3089\u3044\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\u80cc\u4e2d\u3068\u80a9\u3092\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u3067\u3002\u4e2d\u306f\u7167\u660e\u6697\u3081\u3067\u843d\u3061\u7740\u3044\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c\u3001\u5916\u3068\u9762\u3057\u305f\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9\u306f\u5c11\u3057\u7729\u3057\u3044\u304b\u3082\u3067\u3059\u3002\u3067\u3082\u30de\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc\u30b8\u306f\u6700\u9ad8\u3067\u30bb\u30e9\u30d4\u30b9\u30c8\u306e\u65b9\u3082\u3046\u307e\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\u3042\u3048\u3070\u30d5\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u524d\u5f8c\u306b\u307e\u305f\u884c\u304d\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\uff01\n\n",
