        "limpeh Isme\n3 reviews\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nTried this massage down my block over the weekend.\n\nPlace is neat, clean and smells good. Danny is polite and soft-spoken. This is where the \"positives\" end.\n\nGaps: Massage lacks strength and techniques. Rather random and aimless. Massage style is \"piano\" type, soft touch. On top of this, the session ended about 10mins earlier than stipulated time. Only realized after i paid the cash and left.....\n\nVery disappointing experience \ud83d\ude1e\n\n",
        "MN TAN\n1 review\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nFist time trying out this place. Very clean, quiet and comfortable place. The owner is very friendly and provides therapeutic massage at an affordable price. Highly recomended.\n\n",

        "Mag\nLocal Guide\u00b719 reviews\u00b720 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nDidn\u2019t expect much from a small neighbourhood massage place but it turned out one of the best experiences I\u2019ve had so far! The masseur / owner was very skilful and friendly. Throughout my 40 mins back and shoulder massage, the pressure force was consistent and on point. I always have sore lower back due to prolonged sitting, but it feels very relieved after the session. Highly recommended and definitely will be back again!\n\n",

People are very easy-going and easy to chat! What surprised me was that the owner turned out to be a Singaporean who loves freedom! The shop is very quiet, so the owner will do it himself! The surrounding environment is also very relaxing, and the technology is also great! Will go again when I have time!\n\n(Original)\n\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u627e\uff0c\u9760\u8fd1\u78a7\u5c71\u5730\u94c1\u7ad9\uff0c\u5e97\u4e3b\u4eba\u4e5f\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u3002\u4eba\u5f88\u968f\u548c\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u804a\uff01\u8ba9\u6211\u610f\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u7684\u662f\u5e97\u4e3b\u7adf\u7136\u662f\u7231\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u672c\u5730\u4eba\uff01\u5e97\u91cc\u5f88\u5b89\u9759\uff0c\u5c31\u5e97\u4e3b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u81ea\u5df1\u505a\uff01\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e5f\u5f88\u8ba9\u4eba\u653e\u677e\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u4e5f\u662f\u5f88\u68d2\uff01\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u4f1a\u518d\u53bb\uff01\n\n",
