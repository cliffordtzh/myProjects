        "Dol Chew\nLocal Guide\u00b7117 reviews\u00b71,660 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nNew shop name is Master of Massage. Staff are friendly and courteous.\n\nFoot reflexology is $45 for 60mins (includes 10mins of head & shoulder)\n\nFoot + Body is $50 for 60mins.\n\nMy friends choose the foot reflexology which comes with a foot bath and had their treatments done on sitting chair, whereas i had body + foot and was lead into a massage room.\n\nThey provide a pair of disposable shorts for massage and I choose to have no oil for body massage, the therapist is quite strong with her strokes and it gets abit unbearable. After my body massage, i had my foot reflexology on the bed without any foot wash and it makes me feel uncomfortable. The head pillow also smelled n i had used a towel to go over it.\n\nPersonally feel their hygiene practices can be improved.\n\n",
