        "Sean Goh\nLocal Guide\u00b71,261 reviews\u00b76,124 photos\nRated 4.0 out of 5,\nRecently bought a voucher from Fave for an hour of foot massage SGD$28.  Their published rate is SGD$35 for an hour of foot massage. The entire procedure was relatively easy, just call them to make a reservation.  Reached the shop and was directed to another shop on the same stretch, i assume both belong to the same owner. Paid another SGD$4 for an additional 15mins shoulder and back massage base on the receptionist \u013a\n\nI was assigned to a male therapist which was skillful and utillize quite alot of strength. Ambience of the shop was quiet and dark.\n\nAlong the stretch, there are quite a few other massage shops and the rates are quite conpetitive.\n\n",
        "Syafiqah Ismail\nLocal Guide\u00b7186 reviews\u00b7611 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nI got the fave deal for an hour long foot reflexology, with an additional 15 mins of back massage. The place is not called silk massage spa but it is at no. 89 Jalan Sultan.\n\nThe foot massage was good but the back massage really hurt. My friend on the other hand enjoyed the back massage. We were even asked to lie down for the last part. Overall, I think the deal is worth it.\n\n",
        "J\u00f8rgen van Els\u00e4cker\nLocal Guide\u00b719 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nI booked a 3-hour massage. I was very relaxing. The pressure of the masseuse was perfect for me. It was firm and gentle. She had a good feeling for my tension area. After the massage I felt light and energized.\nThe place is neath, room I had was quite and had a good atmosphere. After the treatment they serve tea with biscuits on the side. So for me the price quality ratio is perfect.\n\n",

        "Alicia Gorzen\nLocal Guide\u00b730 reviews\u00b786 photos\nRated 2.0 out of 5,\nI got my ears cleaned here, and then my husband and I got massages. The actual service was good, but masseurs were very rude. They spoke about us in Chinese, which SURPRISE! I speak Chinese. So I could understand them. I was going to say something, but honestly, I wanted to hear how much they would talk about us. My husband and I are a little overweight, but not very overweight. They laughed and joked that they needed bigger massage tables. They said my skin was too flabby, and therefore difficult to massage, and they continued to laugh. Even if I didn\u2019t speak Chinese, I think it would have been pretty obvious that they were teasing us. Management should teach employees to be respectful.\n\n",
        "Anit Arora\nLocal Guide\u00b740 reviews\u00b7110 photos\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nIt's looks fancy but it's not ,the masseuse doesn't understand English at all even the words like oil which the part of her daily thing.\nAC doesn't work properly.\nFull body oil massage means only back that too till waist, they don't even touch thigh and legs in full body massage.\n\n",
        "Daria Danilina\n11 reviews\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nWonderful place to get a massage for a fair price! Definitely do not share some of the sentiment expressed by others. This place is professional and very welcoming. Receptionist speaks good English.\n\n",
        "Dain Sherborne\n2 reviews\nRated 1.0 out of 5,\nHad a 1hr body massage and it was pretty bad on many accounts. The massage itself was basically just the back and head and wasn\u2019t very good, the massage table was uncomfortable, the masseuse was unfriendly, you can hear everything in the massage room next to you and the overall facilities are very basic\n\n",
        "Khiang Seow\nLocal Guide\u00b719 reviews\u00b714 photos\nRated 5.0 out of 5,\nUpdate: Back again and Shirley worked on my body and neck and it feels wonderful! I had the 90 mins massage and it felt like I had more than that! Shirley worked really hard, it felt like every muscle on my back was individually treated. I walked in with a stiff neck and walked out feeling new again.\n\nInitially I thought I had the whole place to myself. It was quiet and peaceful. Towards the last 20 mins or so, others came for massage but one decided to take a phone call and the other was very chatty with his therapist. That burst my peaceful bubble.\n\n2/2019 My traps were hurting bad and with just an hour to kill, i found silk massage nearby. Clean place with professional staff. Had the 60 mins session and focusing only on neck and shoulder. Shirley (Shui Li) was my therapist and she was great! In 1 hr, she eased my discomfort by rolling out the knots. I was in less pain for my activity that night. I went back again today for a second session with her and again I had immediate relief with just an hour. The relief has lasted 6 hours and I am keeping my fingers crossed that it will last a day or two. I recommend silk and Shirley if you are looking to feel good.\n\n",

        "Naomi Gu\n23 reviews\u00b79 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nCame here with my dad to kill some time.\nWe both took the 90 mins package (30 mins foot massage + 60 mins body massage) for 70 dollar.\nIt was alright, i prefer the foot massage.\nBut my dad seemed to really enjoy it. I guess it really depends on your preference. The only thing i have to say though, the staff can't really speak english...\n\n",

He is extraordinarily skilled and very professional.\nCan\u2019t comment on much else as I haven\u2019t tried, except the Chinese tea is also quite good.\n\n",
        "Angelo Polimeno\n90 reviews\u00b7123 photos\nRated 3.0 out of 5,\nVery nice, clean, relaxing... Only thing I don't like to be naked with a bunch of other men. I'd prefer the \"non-Japanese\" system, where everyone wears swimming gear and you have mixed genders, so you can enjoy the company of your significant other and stay longer.\n\n",
