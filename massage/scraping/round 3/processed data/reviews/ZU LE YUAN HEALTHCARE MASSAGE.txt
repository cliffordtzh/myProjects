Glad to find this fantastic massage shop on the heartlands. Went twice and both times the masseuse was very professional in helping to resolve some of the back issues I had.

It was not a relaxation session but more of a healing session to loosen knots. Office workers: Highly recommend this place to look after your physical wellbeing!

My hubby and I booked a session here and Ive got to say this was the BEST MASSAGE  we have ever had in our lives. We never stepped out of a massage feeling so light and relieved before. Amazing service from Jason & Hui Jie. Will definitely be heading back!

Quality for price! Super good neighbourhood find!!! Brought my friends over to try the promos and lmaooo apparently my body identifies as an uncle but after the massage i felt rejuvenated. The masseuse was really professional and didnt press too hard!  Thank you to the team behind this massage place

I went for 3 massages at different places this week, and this place was the one that did it for me.  My therapist was xiao hui, and she did an excellent job, releasing every knots and soreness meticulously, although it was painful as expected from Chinese tui na. For the price they charge, please don't expect a fancy interior, but the bed was clean, all their masseuse are very familiar and chatty with clients, and you can be rest assured it is worth every penny. Will be back!

Had an excellent 60 mins foot massage with free herbal foot bath for $27. Great value and will come again

16/2/20: had a 45min neck, shoulder and back massage cause my neck and shoulders were aching. The massage was painful but effective. Many thanks to the masseuse from China. It was $44 in total - $38 for the massage and $6 for the ginger massage oil
