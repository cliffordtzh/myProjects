Tried this Malay masseuse YAYA! Very nice, very friendly most importantly very genuine person I ever met in massage parlour. I honestly feel 5 star isnt enough for her. You should give it a try and you wont regret. She did a legit job. And I made her my personal masseuse till she is around. God bless.! Stay safe guys

Try Soul Massage for the first time. The place was clean and nice.  Tracy was the therapist attending to me.  She was very skillful and did a fantastic job in addressing to my aching muscles.  It was a relaxing and enjoyable massage.  Will definitely go back for another session with Tracy.

Tried Soul Massage for the first time. Did not make appointment prior to visit. Luckily there were open slots. Was assigned to Abby  for the massage. She was very friendly and easy to get along with; her massage managed to hit the sore spots and she has surprisingly much strength which suited how I like.

Please relay my thanks to Abby, and will definitely recommend and return for next appointment!

First time trying out this place. I never assign any therapist as i didnt know need to choose. Ella did the hot oil massage for me, feeling all the sore and pain from not massaging a long time. Cheerful and nice to talk to. Definitely will come back again soon.

I was attended by Tracy. Shes very attentive to the areas where I feel uncomfortable and keeps checking if I have any problem. She also knows how to adjust her strength to make me feel comfortable. Easy to talk to and a relaxing experience.

Very clean and comfortable place. Easy to find parking and the massage room is spacious. I love the oil essence they used to freshen up the place.
Cheryl was my masseuse and she was really good. The amount of strength used on me was to my liking and she also asked where I felt tired. Very friendly and made me feel at ease.
Will definitely come back again to look for Cheryl!

First time going to this outlet, didnt have any preference for therapist and was assigned Yoyo who recommended the hot oil massage.

Whilst her looks differs a lot from the (obviously photoshopped) photo, her massage strength and skill was solid. Will return again.

Massage itself was ok, but i booked 90 minutes and the massage lady totally lost track on time, so she just stopped in the middle of the massage. Would be okish for me, but after she left, i saw, that it was nearly exact 90min after the start. Considering she also went to the toilet during the session for 5min and that i never experienced such a hard stop in a better spa, felt disappointing. Take it also as a note tvat all ladies inside are from PRC and quite young.
All in all wouldn't recommend for a massage

Massage was gd.the location wasn't too good and I felt the pics are very photo shopped.when I asked the receptionist twice is the masseuse so and so,she did not answer me and I gave up.i don understand is the face mask covering my voice.

She was so listless.it really turned out to be the one.i just feel she could have answer me.i we'd better go to the sisters branches.

At Opal Crescent to have my famous fish steamboat dinner on Tuesday evening. As the time is still early, decided to pop by The Palace Spa for a massage.
The masseur that attend to me was Yoyo. I am ready for a hard massage and Yoyo does not disappoint me. Her skill is superb and constantly asked me whether is the strength is right whenever she shift to a new portion of my body.  I really had a good run down and felt that my soreness around my neck had disappeared.  Thank you for a good massage
