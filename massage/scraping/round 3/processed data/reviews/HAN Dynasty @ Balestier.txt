$80 for 1.5 hours massage. Highly recommend Sandy for people who like pressure. She incorporates a bit of Thai style massage into her moves which leaves me extremely refreshed

Very good massage. A little bruised the day after though. My own fault that I tried to take the pain.   They did ask if it was too hard. Ill definitely be back

Got a 1.5hour oriental massage done by a massue name Fei Fei. She is skillful and systematic. Can try if you need someone with strength and skill. Imagine i am 90 plus kilograms and i can feel the pressure when she press on my stiff back.

the masseuse really put in a lot of effort. went with my wife and the massage was really good, only that the front desk receptionist did not even care to pass/or tell us about the tea that was kept by the masseuse, maybe she was overwhelmed with tasks. Even then the receptionist when we went in did not seem to be cordial. so one star removed for that otherwise the masseuses' put in a lot of effort an its really worth the money

My husband and I visited this place for a one hour body massage, and it was heavenly. The session was painful but so effective that we had such a good deep sleep upon returning home. Even though the session was painful, I woke up the next day with no aches, which I usually experience if the masseuse doesn't know what they're doing.

My 1st visit to this salon and I loved it. Easy to make an appointment, staff speak English, clean, good price and quality. Ladies deal on Tuesdays is definitely worth it!

First time, massage was very light but cos its near our place, we decided to buy the package anyway.
Second time here, we requested for stronger masseuse and the massage is good this time.
But both times we find it unacceptable that the staff outside the room all speak very loudly, I am here to have a nap and rest but I was woken up several times because of their chatter. First time it was a local staff kept chattering in hokkein/teochew, this time is all the Chinese staff shouting back & forth like a market.
This is a massage place packaged to be spa like, customers are coming here to rest and relax not listen to all these market chatter about urine. If this doesnt improve we will not continue the package again.

Clean and comfortable environment.
Good session with Mindy and highly recommend. She's able to detect and apply strength on my pain spots / knots on my shoulders and back.
There's yummy dessert after the session too.
P.s. session was done in Dec-2019.

The massage was great, but I cannot believe my eyes when the massues did not flush their toilet after use, and it's not just once but twice and in a few cubicles! I even saw 1 massue ran out of the toilet after use, without flushing the toilet and do not even wash hands! What if she's rushing to attend to a customer with dirty hands? This is totally disgusting, unhygienic and shocking! Especially in this times when Covid-19 is still spreading! I'm not sure if I wanna go back ever again even the poor hygiene level. (Ps. I gave 2 stars because the massue massage skill is good).

This place looks even better after its renovations. The service here is good and lots of care is provided by the masseurs. The rooms have private showering facilities for customers and the environment is relaxing. In my opinion, the masseurs' skills are good and I would visit again.

Worst service i have paid for an $80 massage. Came here as a regular but to only realise masseurs always cut time 10 minutes before end of session. Measured time only from my last three visits to realise their clock in the massage room is 10 minutes faster. Felt so deprived wasting my $80 here. They think customers are rich and print money to come here. Please do not do not do not visit the balestier outlet.

After the owner responded to me in this threat, they informed me to call their hotline because they wanted to investigate. After calling on 30th August, counter person informed me to call another number instead. Then why put your hotline number in the first place? Why not just give me the direct managers number? They also did not call me back. As spoken, I have went on 3 occasions before putting this one star review so please dont bother investigating.

Even 1 star is too high for them. Bad experience, first & last time. TOLD doing massge for 2 or 3 of us, while waiting for another friend to reply, they gave away the two vacancies to walk in. Should have at least check with me again(I am just 5 m away from counter.
When asked for someone, one of the staff look at me and just turn away......26/11/18 1 PM.

(Translated by Google) This is a great spa. I've been to a great spa twice. The second time I made an appointment with Julie who gave me a massage for the first time. She was great, the service was very good, and very caring! The second time I took the scrub, she suggested changing to a walking can, worrying that I would experience it
Into the wind! She has 10 years of experience and the massage is in place! I really like it! Relieved my fatigue! Super relaxing the next day! I will look for her in the future! Highly recommend her!
