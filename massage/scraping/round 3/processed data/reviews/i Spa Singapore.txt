Such an honest place! I'm a regular here. Love strong Chinese masseuse! Also, one time I left my favourite ring. Was sure I wouldn't get it back but went to ask anyway and they kept it! Thank you!

Just went for a 2hr warm oil massage with Bella. Therapist is very professional and skillful. All my tensed muscles are totally relaxed after the session. Will definitely come back again.

86 for a warm oil full body, done by malay lady. Ok, not bad, not as painful as some China therapists. Calf massage is excellent. Shoulders not as experienced, maybe tired from day. Clean.

One of the worst experience my wife and me have ever had in our 20 years of SPA visiting. Uninterested and untrained massuers, who shockingly fell asleep during massage. Had to be woken up time and again. Pressed the tail bone and other muscles in the wrong places, causing severe pain that is sure to last for more than three days. It's peaking a day after the massage already..

Not worth even one star. Clearly the other good reviews seem to be either internal our sponsored. Must avoid at any cost..

Wasted our health, time and money..

Saw your response, and thanks for correcting us. Hope you can do something about your service too. The masseur sleeping off during the massage is not acceptable. Suddenly waking up and trying to catch up on the massage is what is causing us the pain now.

I have tried several spas in Singapore. But idea is the best. The rooms are nice and clean. I got massage from Oliva. She is well trained masseuse, good pressure and technique. She is very expert. The best.

Made an online booking n received an email too. Appointment is only confirmed after receptionist called. But not often they call back. I got the masseuse I booked online. Very happy!

But once when about to start, receptionist mentioned my appointment with her is not confirmed as they didnt call me. So I got another whom Im not...disappointment a little.

Few days ago booked online again for this masseuse for today 12noon. But receptionist called me exactly 12noon today. I said sorry, I cant make it oredi
I dont know why its like so. Maybe overlook online bookings or busy everyday? I think Ill call in and book a slot next time...maybe better.

Below are my report done a while ago...

Parking is of abundance. Just minutes from MRT on foot. The setting is cozy n dimly lighted. There is a reception area for customers to sit n relax while waiting. Mine was an individual room with sliding door. My room has an attach shower place. But not sure why the room Im in is a little warm. A proper massage bed n some hangers/hooks for your clothings. Room is quite small but yet sufficiently big to move around. Got two sets of towels to shower b4 n after. Bath with warm or cold water as u wish. Soft background music is playing to lift up the atmosphere. My masseuse is a Thai lady, Miss V. She has amazing skill of relieving my body ache n send soothing feeling to my whole being. She was politely asking me if the pressure is ok with me. We also chatted causally n she communicated well in good spoken English. Think this going to be my regular relaxing MP.
Do try them out...and enjoy...

Googled for nearby massage after a long day at the zoo, and wow, what a fantastic place, ambiance was nice, price was acceptable, recep was welcoming, masseur was very well trained. One of the best local massage I should say. Worth a re-visit.
