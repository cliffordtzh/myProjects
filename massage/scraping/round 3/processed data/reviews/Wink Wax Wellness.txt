Would like to give a good feedback on Nadhirah as the process was done smoothly. She's really kind to ask if I'm doing okay in the midst. Overall, it was clean and I'm really impressed on the service she has done! Highly recommend her if you guys would like to book under her. Definitely would come again for my next appointment!

I was seen to by Ann and she did an great job! She was very friendly and bubbly, service was great, I actually thought it was done better than some better known places I have been to (won't say the name but they're in orchard area haha) Price was fantastic as a first time customer. Even the alacart price was better than other places by about $30. I was initially a lil scared that the service wouldn't be good as it's cheap and in a very small unit at tanjong pagar, but I'm very happy I chose to come here.

Actually even when I called in, the person on the phone when I initially booked my appt was very very friendly and jovial, not sure if it was Ann but either way, I was very pleased with the service and Def will be back. Thanks Ann!!

My therapist, Ann is jovial and patient. Her reassuring attitude and services definitely made me feel comfortable and calm throughout the session.  The staff are polite and professional. Not at all pressurizing as there are no hard-selling. Their prices are still quite reasonable. Hope they continue to remain competitive.  With effective results, comfortable experience and excellent service, I am happy to be a customer of Wink Wax and will continue to patronize them.

When I think Waxing in Singapore? I think of Ann!

Ann is an incredibly attentive and thoughtful beauty therapist! I'm a big fan of hers for many reasons. I've been going to salons for waxing for many many years. But coming to Asia I found that some waxing therapists do a rushed job and they are not quality therapists. I've been in Singapore for 2 years now and have only been going to her.

Ann has a unique way of making you feel comfortable. She is considerate and she is very funny. I think it's important to not only have great customer service but genuinely show you care for your customers. I recommend her to my work colleagues and other friends when they are looking for wax and beauty therapists. She's become a part of my 'Go To Ladies' for beauty. I won't recommend anyone else to my network! Ann is knowledgeable, experienced and simply the best!

Ann was amazing! She was very efficient and the whole hair removal process was as pain free as it could be and fuss free. The best part was the whole time we were having a good laugh as Ann is very humorous and really was able to put me at ease. I felt like I was having laughter therapy and it put me in a good mood! I would strongly recommend Ann's services and Wink Wax at Tanjong Pagar!

I like to compliment Ann for being such a great service provider. She makes the whole waxing process an ease and a pleasant experience. Highly professional and skilful, she is also relational and genuinely cares for her client. She assessed my pain threshold, knows I am terrified of laser but is able to reassure me during the laser process. I have been to other waxing salons and laser services and I think Ann provides the best so far. I highly recommend her to anyone who wants to do waxing or laser. Great job Ann!

I highly recommend Wink Wax Wellness! My beautician Ann always provided the best customer service. From the minute you walk into the salon you feel so welcome, and Ann makes you feel extremely comfortable. Her work is always so quick but as painless as possible, which is so important! My results were beyond what I expected - you wont be disappointed. And Ann always made sure she offered the best packages possible. I live in the UK now but I visit Ann for IPL at the salon whenever I visit Singapore!

I first met Ann 2 years ago when I signed up for a trial session of Brazilian waxing and I am a loyal customer since then. Ann is professional, outgoing, fun and makes one feels comfortable during the session. I was feeling so nervous (and shy) as this is the first time I'm doing Brazilian waxing but Ann showed her professionalism by letting me know what she was doing the entire session while trying to calm me down by talking to me the whole time. Ann is not pushy and understands what I need before recommending the package or session that is most suitable and money-worthy for me. I would strongly recommend Ann to anyone who wants to try any of their services. (In fact I did and now, she's also another loyal customer of Ann)

I have been going to Wink Wax for almost 10 years now (can't remember when i actually starting visiting them). It started with waxing treatment and now i am doing my laser hair removal with them. The therapists are all very friendly and my favourite is Lyan. She is very professional and always makes me feel relaxed. I enjoy my chats with her during my treatment. She is honest, reliable and non-pushy at all. Gives good advice on your condition before recommending any treatment - nothing unnecessary. The treatments have been very effective however I don't go as often as before as currently the treatments I do are just for maintenance purpose. Also i think it is great to show some support to small local business like them in difficult time like this.

I have been doing my waxing with Ann for more than a year now. This is my second time purchasing their waxing package! Ive tried waxing at several different places and I always prefer wink because my sessions are so fast, comfortable and as painless as it can get. Ann is extremely professional and we always have a nice chat so I can distract myself from the pain   As a broke student, I appreciate that there is no hard selling involved and I never feel pressured to purchase more than what I want. Booking appointments are extremely fuss free too. I can foresee that I will be a regular customer.

As a regular customer for the past 5 years, I see Wink Wax as a very professional set-up, and they ensure that their respective outlets maintain a high level of professionalism, cleanliness and service. Their branding in the market is a sweet spot between great quality and value / price. I personally don't feel like I'm overpaying for their service.

What is the most important for me as a customer is that they do not practice any "hard-selling" techniques to get me to purchase additional packages / services. The way they manage their sales is very organic and client-centric, which essentially means that you are not being constantly hustled into buying something. This lays the base for a very relaxed and worry-free environment to walk into.

You will also find that the specialists at Wink Wax come from an experienced background of waxing services. One such specialist is Ann Tan, who embodies the company's values and what they do best in - professionalism, quality services, cleanliness and punctuality. She is also a great conversationalist which helps to ease any awkwardness. It is very evident that Ann takes pride is what she does, and puts her clients' needs first. She is also very knowledgable in this line of business, given her many years of experience. She is my go-to specialist.

It is not hard to see why Wink Wax is highly successful in this industry, and why they have a huge client base. I'd highly recommend (10/10) those who are in the market for great quality-value waxing services.

The place makes you feel instantly welcomed. Your beautician/therapist is a value-add to your life, on a personal level. (Dont get me wrong, they dont probe they provide you with a good listening ear and they make even me wanna share). I dont speak highly of many things in life but I am sure, if anyone wants good waxing/hair removal or any beauty services done, this Is a place that should never be missed. My therapist Ann is the third waxing therapist Ive had, and Im sure shes gonna be my last for as long as Im in Singapore.

Ann is very professional, friendly and honest. Her genuine sincerity towards her customers is what makes each session enjoyable. Understanding her customers well is what makes Ann great at her job as she remembers their preferences even if it has been quite a long time since she has seen them. She also does not push her customers towards loyalty but instead allows them the freedom to explore their options. =)

I have been with Wink Wax Wellness Tanjung Pagar for more than 6 years now and my current therapist is Ann. I am very much pleased with Ann's services thus far. Ann gives very detailed recommendations, explaining the benefits and the duration needed to be able to see results. She clearly breaks down the costs and payment schemes for my consideration. Ann is very thorough during sessions, ensuring customer's satisfaction with her services. Over the years, Ann is not only my therapist, she has also become a good friend whom I look forward to meeting on a bi-monthly or monthly basis. I highly recommend anyone who is considering Wink Wax for the first time to make an appointment with Ann to experience what I have explained above for themselves. :)

Wink Wax is my preferred choice for waxing! I was referred by a friend for a trial after many sub-par waxing experiences in Singapore. My therapist, Ann, is very friendly and funny and always go the extra mile to make every session as comfortable for me as possible. One thing I really like about Wink Wax and what really sets them apart is that they do not push you to sign up for thousands of dollars worth of packages - they have a very reasonable package deal and they don't hard sell or get you to add on services which is why I keep coming back!

Thanks Ann & team!

I have been going to Wink Wax for their Brazilian waxing and IPL services for over ten months. The package may seem pricey at first but trust me, it is money well spent. As a first timer, I felt that getting a Brazilian done to be a very intimate and intimidating process  having to expose yourself to a complete stranger. However, I am very fortunate to have Ann as my therapist. Her warm, bubbly and reassuring personality made my first-time experience a very smooth and comfortable one. Ann is also quick and efficient  qualities you need in a therapist to ensure that the process is as painless as possible! Needless to say, my experience for subsequent sessions were as positive as my first. I appreciate that Ann goes above and beyond her job by building rapport with her customers (I cant imagine anyone else doing IPL for me!) and not hard-selling packages. In all, I highly recommend Ann from Wink Wax as she delivers both quality service and product. She has made me a very happy and hairless (at the right places) individual! (:

Have been going to WinkWax for almost a year now! Decided to buy a 10x package with them after my first trial as my waxing fairy is the nicest lady and made me feel at home, not nervous at all even though my pain tolerance is 0. If you're a first timer for waxing, I would highly suggest you look for Ann! She has been in the industry for so long and she would understand your skin condition and advice you accordingly to what you should do and should not do. Already bought my second package from her and there's nothing better than good service that keeps your customers going back.

Furthermore, they do not coerce customer into purchasing services, same cannot be said for many similar businesses in the beauty line. Instead, they provide good advice to customer on suitable services. Definitely a great place for waxing etc, glad I stumbled across them all those years ago.

I just visited their shop few days ago, and I have been using their service for more then 10 years now. They are one of the few that provide full waxing and optical hair removal service for male client in Singapore, which include Brazilian waxing. Joyce will be the person to look for if you want to be service by a female therapist. (Although they also has one male therapist for servicing the male client) She has been my therapist since day one with very good and professional service.
For now, I'm going back every one or two months to have some maintenance, and their service package is very attractive too, especially during their promotion period, very value for money.

What I like most with WinkWax is that I always feel comfortable with them. I think it is very important to build trust with your client with this type of service. Ms. Joyce is always pleasant and she gives me tips on how to have better skin. Waxing is sometimes painful but somehow, I always feel relaxed after each session. Personally, these are all important to me as I have tried many other waxing salons that somehow made me feel awkward. Most definitely highly recommended!

Lyan has been my therapist and an excellent one! She ensures that I'm comfortable at every single visit and always ensures that she does her job right. Not only that, her colleagues - Ann and others - are also very friendly and pleasant to talk to at the reception area. I have never once felt disappointed after my treatment.

Have been a loyal customer with Wink Wax for slight more than a year. The OPL really works for me. What I like about Wink Wax is that it is kept clean and the staff are super friendly and makes me feels at ease. It will always be my go-to recommendation for anyone who is looking for hair removal services at great prices.

My first time to get brazilian waxing in Singapore. Before I am scared to try but Ann is very professional and handling me with care. She is very friendly and always checking with me if I still feel okay because of her this whole waxing made painless. The whole ambiance of the salon is very great and clean also. I will surely recommend this to my friends. The best brazilian waxing experience!

She taught me aftercare and things to take out note . The environment is clean and private . Professional and smiley . I would still choose Wink Wax tanjong pargar in a heartbeat !

All staff are super friendly and professional. I have been to wink wax tanjong pagar since 2015. I been served by therapist Joyce since the start of my Brazilian waxing. All of us know well that it's super shy and awkward especially on your first trial with Brazilian waxing. I still remmeber how Joyce comfort and chat with me on my first try. Her friendly service and professional service make me don't have second doubt to come back to them again and again. Try it and you will be happy with it.

I started going to Wink Wax 2+ years ago after trying out several places in SG. What made me really decide on the place was 1) the good deals & service they offered but more importantly 2) their staff, namely Ann, who was such a wonderful and personable member of the Wink staff. She made me feel good about the process and comfortable from day 1. Thank you!!

I have been doing Brazilian waxing for many years. Moving to Singapore 3 year ago, I have tried and been dissatisfied by several companies and therapists. I have finally found a professional, clean and comfertable wax therapist, Lyan with this company at their Tanjong Pagah Outlet. I have been engaging my service with  her for 2 years. Highly recommended.

I was pretty nervous during my first appt cos i read online about hw painful waxing was. So i was pleasantly surprised during my first appt when i felt no pain at all. The entire session was super comfortable and the lady who did waxing for me, Ann, was super friendly and nice to talk to as well and ive been hooked on waxing ever since. Its super quick and easy to book an appt and i highly recommend this place for their fast booking and amazing service :)

Staffs are always friendly and sincere when serving their customers. Very professional treatment as well. Lyan never fail to make me feel welcome and will always check on the temperature of wax and level of pain. Ever when I hear anothet staff and client converse in another room, its usually the same standard. Very consistent and good.

Wink Wax does waxing and IPL for men too by a male therapist. The staff here are always polite and professional, and I feel great to drop by each time! Their prices seem reasonable too and there is  no hard selling of services here, so go with a peace of mind knowing you will be smooth afterwards  :)

I've been going to Winkwax for 5 years and it's solely because of the professionalism and service given by the only male therapist, Mike. Last week, I was very disappointed to find out that Mike is leaving after 7 years and I quickly got an appointment to have my last waxing session done by him. I really hope he comes back again or as a part timer because he is the only one I trusted to do waxing for me as he was the only male and there was a rapport built. Now I'm not sure on how to move on with Winkwax because I still have $400+ credits left and the only reason I took it up was because of Mike. And now with Mike gone, I hope Winkwax comes up with an alternative solution for customers affected by Mike's departure.
