The staff in Golden Pail are very professional and skilled, especially the Lady Boss. Would highly recommend a visit if your body is feeling sore!

Massage worth every penny. The 90 minutes massage has free ear candling or body scrub too. The masseuses can speak basic English, good enough for you to let them know what kind of massage you need. Recommended and will be visiting again.

Called before going in to confirm availability.
Went with a 60 minute package of foot and lower back massage.
The foot massage, though hard, was very relaxing and quite good.
The lower back massage included hard pressure as well but I really felt good after the full hour massage.
The shop was clean, convenient and pleased with the service!

Had an awesome experience at the Golden Pail spa. I had crunched up my back and thigh muscles from an excercise session and was finding it really hard to walk or move around. Heard a lot of good reviews about Golden Pail Spa and wanted to try the place as it was close to where i was staying. Took a 90min Therapy session. The shower area, the bed and the surroundings were kept neat with extra towels. The therapist was sure to use the pressure points correctly to ease my back pain. Further more after the session, I was also given a back scrub within the 90 mins period. All in all, it was a 10/10 for me. The two most important aspects of this place, (i) the prices are reasonable compared to the other places around. (ii) The therapist was fully professional and NO naughty business, which made it easier for me as a guy to be comfortable. Thank you to the Golden Pail Spa team who made it an excellent experience for me. Will surely be dropping in the next time as well.

The place to get a massage after a long day. The prices are reasonable and the rooms are clean and comfortable. The service staff are always courteous and accommodating. Been coming here at least once a week since they opened over a year ago. Were even friends with all the masseuse :-)

Nice and clean place for a hard massage. Friendly staff. Shower in every room so you can come here after your exercise, take a shower before your massage. English language may be an issue as the masseurs are mainly mainland Chinese and Vietnamese.

As a frequent spa massuer lover myself, partly because of my perpetually stiff neck since young. I have embark on my journey of spa-exploration. since about 5 years ago.
Out of the numerous shop I visit. (At least 40) Slowly I built a own go-to-place list whenever I have a ache or just want to be pamper.
Often I pass by this Golden Pail Spa but never walk in. Mainly because there isnt any
Then one fine day, while trying to get a fix on my neck. I tried the massage there.

Guess what. This is it
The hunt is over.
This is the place when I know I will get the massage that will relive my aching problem.

Initially was on 1 hr + 1 hr.
Not only the massuer who serve me was polite, attentive and meticulous from the Get-go. She also took extra attention in attending to the ouch and ahh of the sound that I couldnt help mumbling out when she hit the right spot.

Main point, that night I slept well. (I have problem sleeping ever since divorced. ) nothing short of amazing, maybe is just me or some other experiences the same thing. Whatever it is they are doing. They are doing it right.

During this covid period, it is also comforting to know that they are strict on the mask wearing, sanitise the rooms before and after i use. And strangers like me hanging around kept with social distancing.
(I purposely stay a while more to see how is the rest of the environment like la.)

It been a Long time since I wrote a review, nonetheless I hope it serve it purpose.

P.S) to add icing to the whole deal, because of the 2 hrS there is  rub sand, it is like using scrub facial wash to wash your face but instead this is done to your whole body. I get to experience it for the first time too and wow.

This is why I say the hunt is over.
Kudos to the leader and the team for placing such importance to the customer like me and I gonna see you soon. :)

Have been to Golden Pail SPA @ Thomson on weekly basis for body massage and occasionally for reflexology since October 2018. Their massage were consistently up to my expectation i.e. correct pressure and strength at right places. The staff there are friendly and I had welcoming feeling all the times. I guess I will continue with this routine foreseeable future.
