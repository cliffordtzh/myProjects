First time visiting here upon recommendation from a friend and had no regrets. Clean and quiet vibes  perfect for an hour or two of relaxation. The masseuse I had was skilled and the massage was amazing.

Absolutely no package sales pressure tactic whatsoever, in fact they didnt talk about it at all at the counter or during the massage.

Will recommend and will come again!

The best massage I've had in Singapore, and I've tried at least 50 different places. At ease has the best therapists and I love the lighting and the music they play there. It's very reasonable priced, and a special mention of Rose, who is the best masseuse I've had in Singapore by a long shot. Their membership is very reasonable, and member costs are really very reasonable. They also give a membership insurance which protects the customers if the spa closes down. % will recommend this place

1) All masseurs are highly skilled and can give a good rubdown.
2) The ambience is so comfortable. Dimmed lights, soothing ambient music, cool and comfortable environment.
3) The little touches really perk me up: Cold towels before the massage, warm foot soak before massage, flower tea served before massage, big and comfortable massage chairs, free and fast WiFi, and free apples for customers. Talk about holistic enjoyment!
4) the price point is really valuable considering all they are providing to clients.

I would absolutely be recommending this to anyone who asks. And if I may go one step further, I think this is the best massage place in Singapore!

Formerly known as Ming Zu Foot Reflexology in Upper Bukit Timah which offered good massage. Quiet environment for relaxing. Suggest to book in advance to avoid disappointment.
