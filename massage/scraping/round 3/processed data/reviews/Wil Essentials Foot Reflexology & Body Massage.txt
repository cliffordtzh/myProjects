After coming to Wil Essentials, I've never step foot on another massage parlour ever since. It is not for the lighthearted, you will feel the sore for days to come but come out rejuvenated. Each move pushes deep into your muscles. They also offer an affordable price compared to other places. Wil is the place of my choice as long as I am still staying nearby.

Very good and strong massage by Ah Tian (hopefully I got his name correct ), he is insanely strong and pressed perfect, definitely knows what hes doing. Was abit sceptical to see 89 reviews and a average of 4.9 stars but wow having come here Ive come to know why they deserve it. Place is very small and cozy but well lit. Prices are very good too and only con I can see is lack of a private room and oil massage which I understand due to the size of the place. However, masseuse skill is top notch. Definitely coming back again. Hope opening hours will extend pass 10 next time!

Googled for massage near our home and the positive reviews really lived up to its name! Seems like we've found a real gem! My wife and I were really impressed by Alvin & Tian's massage. They were extremely meticulous in massaging out the knots and lymph nodes and we felt very light and good after the massage. Would definitely return!

Located at a small neighbourhood heartland mall, am impressed with the massage service provided.
The masseur was spot on with all my aching points and she even massaged the lymph nodes spots which alot of massage places do not do so.
The lady boss is very friendly and nice to speak to.
The price is very reasonable and very value for money!
Will definitely be back to try other masseurs' touch.

A total new experience. By far the best deep tissue massage I have had. Masseur was undoubtedly highly skillful and very knowledgeable. Understands my condition and needs.They made it a point to explain and also freely share their knowledge along the way. Appreciate that they are not pushy but instead encouraged to return for subsequent sessions only when I feel my body is ready. Worth the intense pain because I can feel the overall improvement in my total well-being after two sessions.

This is my first time going for foot reflexology in Singapore as the shop is very near my house,
since its newly open and also the price is very cheap. I gave it a try. The shop is very clean, leave your shoes outside and I like the how clean and tidy the floor is, it really makes me want to lay down on the floor. The ambience smells great, relaxing and brings up my mood. So I went for 30 mins Foot massage and the masseuse named  was indeed really very good at it. He knows how to use the correct amount of strength to press onto my feet and this is the first time I ever say Shiok! while stretching my leg after my 30 mins session. Lady boss Sherry was very friendly, humble, open minded and our conversation strucked me to stay longer to have a chat with her. To be honest, my own opinion is that I would prefer an open concept massage so we are able to socialise with the other customers and do random talks, it really feels great not just for your feet but also your mood. I went out happily, satisfied and I would definitely bring my whole family down to the outlet. Its my first but wont be my last. I will be trying their body massage soon and I will update the review again. Thank you Wil Essential for launching an outlet near my place. Dont forget to leave a small tip for your masseuse, appreciate them.
