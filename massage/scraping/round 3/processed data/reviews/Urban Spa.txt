Where shall I start? Jennys (the owner) hospitality is second to none other. She not only provides a service based on your needs but also provides guidance and food the soul in wisdom, kindness and recommendations. I chose Urban Spa based on the reviews and I am not disappointed. Coco was my therapist. She was very attentive, applied the perfect amount of pressure and spent an excellent amount of time on my most tense areas. They even offered me ginger tea, dessert and water after the treatment. If you are ever in the area I highly recommend Urban Spa. Thank you ladies!!!

I love how everything was explained nicely to us before the start of our massage. From the types of massages they offered to the smell of the essential oils and scrubs. Got to give it to my massuer Winter for being attentive and gentle yet strength applied on point at the same time (told them beforehand that my pain tolerance is very low).
Mostly importantly, no hard selling at all. Smart move because they know that customers will be back again if they are satisfied with their service.
Went on Christmas day and they even had a small deco in the couple room to welcome us! Thank you lady boss Jenny and team for the warm hospitality :)

Came by for a couple massage with my wife for her birthday and really enjoyed the session.
- The team is very professional and hospitable. Jenny (the spa owner I believe) took the time to sit down with us and go through the various massage options including types of massage, focus areas, usage of oils. She even demonstrates the level of pressure which is very useful to help customers decide!
Any administrative requirements (eg providing ID) were clearly explained which really showed professional due diligence.
Our masseurs were Elva and Coco, who were very pleasant and responsive to our physical cues to ensure that our massage was a comfortable experience.
- The interior/facilities may not be the most posh/up to date, however it's clear that there is a lot of pride in keeping the premises clean and well maintained. Blankets/towels all smelt fresh and I was very pleasantly surprised while using the male washroom, which was spotless.
- Finally, what really ties it all together are all the little touches:
There was some cute decor done to celebrate my wife's birthday
Warm water/hot ginger tea promptly served before/after the massage
Beds are heated/warmed and the customer is always kept cosy with warm towels and blankets.

Brought my grandma to this place for couple massage, consecutively for 2 days. Experience 4 different masseuse. They are all polite, each have their own unique techniques. We like them all, but it still depends alot on personal preference. Have to try to know. They also have a caring and friendly front desk lady boss, shared with us some important points about massage. Appreciate the time she spend on sharing her knowledge. Can feel her love for people and passion for massage    Will definitely come back again. Thank you

My new favorite place for foot massages! Im on my feet a lot, whether its running or walking around Singapore. Ive been feeling tired lately and went to Urban Spa for a massagethey have great ratings online and I decided to give it a chance. Im glad I did bc the service is A+. Its clean, professional, and has great customer service. I was greeted with ginger tea and later ended the massage with green bean soup and hot water. I feel like its the little things that really matter when it comes to my customer loyalty, which theyve won. Jenny and Coco are great in their service and Im definitely recommending them to my friends!!

Great service. Went here for a bday retreat with my partner. I was impressed with the top service provided. They even arranged a surprise couple room and decorated it with Birthday decorations.
Before the massage started, Jenny, explained the types of massage and services to us. No hard sell at all, very friendly and polite. Masseuse was professional, gentle and patient. For once i did not feel like it was rushed. Was also given an option to shower in room which was great to just fully relax and unwind. Overall great experience, prices are very affordable esp in town area. looking forward to be back.

Jenny took time to  communicate about the treatments ive selected & offers recommendations to change your treatments accordingly.

Emphasis on communicating clearly to our masseuse on our preferences and needs during treatments.

Its not a fancy spa but its clean & neat! Im pleasantly surprised by my masseuse.  Coco was professional & experienced, allowing me  to relax & enjoy my treatments!

Will return to try their onsen facility  & other treatments in future!

It was my second time doing a full body massage here, and I drifted off both times -- it was that relaxing. Unfortunately due to Covid, they weren't able to serve any drinks or dessert, but I will definitely come back again.

Thoroughly enjoyed my massage here! Spa owner, Jenny, was very hospitable and that in itself made the entire experience memorable. She found my friend and I slots for an hour's massage each, despite it being a busy Saturday night. She also proceeded to send me very precise photo directions to the spa. The spa is extremely clean and sanitary, with rooms that come with en-suite shower. The therapist who attended to me was very attentive to the pain points on my body. Quality is assured and I'll definitely be back for their other services!

I always have a pleasant experience when I go for a massage at Urban Spa.
The room is neat, clean n comfortable.

Miss Winter , the masseuse gives me a great
relaxing massage ( can fall asleep also)!

Miss Hana, the spa's receptionist is very professional. There are texts from her to remind n confirm with me for my massage appointment.

She also patiently explained to me about the sauna , jacuzzi n dipping pool when I enquired about the cost, time n usage of the facilities.

When paying for the massage , the staff are very careful n there is another senior person which makes sure all the money/card payment is done correctly n accurately.
Very important this arrangement !

All in all , a very good experience in a professional place.

In future will try the sauna facilities.

Thanks dear ladies

Went for a massage treatment at Urban Spa on 9 November 2020 and I was really blown away by their fantastic service and warm hospitality from both staff and boss. From my booking to the actual consultation, the entire process with Urban Spa was hassle free. Their foot reflexology with back massage was very professional, extremely soothing and therapeutic. After a good massage, I was served with good ginger tea and local desserts such as green bean soup which is healthy and enriching. The spa facility is extremely clean and well maintained. As a first time customer, the promotion prices were very attractive and affordable. Special thanks and appreciation to Jenny who was very friendly, passionate and informative about various spa/massage knowledge. A very underrated spa I would say. There should be more hype and many people talking about it! Will definitely come back again with friends and family in the near future! Highly recommended. Keep up with the great services. Thank you :)

Very polite and service oriented spa but some aspects made me minus 1 star - kept rushing us to change and whether we wanna bathe after massage cos they were rushing to clear the room for the next couple... i think they shld have put more buffer time when scheduling guests. Also, my masseuse was inconsistent in pressure, oftentimes rubbing oil on my limbs many times... she didnt massage my Toes and Fingers too!!! While the other masseuse did it for my partner... so inconsistent. She tried to unknot some knots several times to no avail and finally pressed real hard and then moved on to other areas. Hmmm could have given slightly more effort there.
For the price I would say its okay. Comes with ginger tea and a chinese dessert at the end! $120 for 2 pax 1 hour. Good to try out! U may like it!

Truly a hidden gem in Singapore. I always had experiences exploring Singapore spas and this has the best customer service I ever encountered . The receptionist was extremely patient with the numerous phone calls I make and the staffs were all very welcoming when I arrived on short notice . The spa owner , Jenny was the highlight of my spa experience. She was very enthusiastic when getting to know me and informative on various massage knowledge . Moreover,  the masseuse was very professional and attentive to the pressure she was applying on me . Overall, I would say their foot reflexology with back massage was very relaxing and  therapeutic!

Went for the first time on the new year after our staycay. Quite impressive greetings and able to arrange suitable time. Also each customer will be given a piece of form and asked on requested focus area to concentrate on.

The foot massage was okay but not the best because regardless of informing them on the form that I prefer more focus on my calf, not much time were spent there. More time were spent on the feet itself. So, not sure if the information were passed down or customer need to say it again. Which would be redundant.

Can't recall much about my body massage because I was too hung up on how my foot massage was.

Also were asked if I wanted dessert but I left without having it because it was not served. Meh.

Place has a smoking room while waiting for your turn.

Overall, it's just okay. Not too sure if it's worth recommending though. Perhaps you might want to reiterate about what goes on the form.

Went to urban spa for the first time with my friend recently and the service was nice with welcome drink being served and friendly staff. We chose 90mins swedish massage and i can say that the massage was nice but rushing at the same time. We didnt bother that much but thought of giving a feedback to them for improvement.

A guy came and i assumed its their boss and we gave our feedback but it seems that he just didnt want to listen to us and walked off just like that. Its unacceptable to treat a customer rudely. Upset with the overall and definitely wont comeback again

It was a good first experience. However, it would be great if they had followed through on the 'survey' 'questions' that were asked upon arrival.

Amazing experience at this shop nestled in Excelsior Tower (make sure you pass BOTH the hotel and Excelsior Shopping Centre to get there; googlemaps has their info wrong). The place is in a old building but it has a nice spa ambience that is most importantly, kept pristine and in great condition. The staff are friendly and my therapist, Winter, was brilliant. She was professional, and meticulous as well as check up on me if the pressure was to my liking.
The cherry on top was that they don't incessantly try to sell you packages and disrupt your experience because they don't do packages! They work off a loyalty system where you buy your sessions as you visit and they reward you after a certain number of visits with more sessions. It's perfect for people like me who are trying to stop buying packages that I don't use enough. Will definitely come again!

most definitely the worse massage ever received. i went home feeling very oily all over. im sure the masseuse was even falling asleep while giving me a head "massage" which was nothing close to a massage she was petting my head. other than the back, no effort and strength was put into the legs, arms , head for sure. also, they did the back srub first instead of last. front counter very friendly and not pushy. but overall not even worth the $30 spent as fave voucher. i dont understand why there are so many good reviews here. and fave doesnt show the bad reviews..

I love the place and the staff were very friendly and professional in their services... the most i like was they will always serve any dessert of the day to us after our massage was done. Definitely I will recommend this spa to everyone. Good Job!!!

Fabulous service. From the time we entered the premises, the manager was friendly and informative. She recommended the different treatments available to our needs. The Ginger tea was refreshing. The massage we got was great.

Fantastic service! They serve you with tea and snacks before and after massage. Even provide you with shorts to change into if you are doing their foot reflexology. No hardselling at all. Nice and comfortable ambience.

I cannot believe there were several high ratings for this spa. It is the worst I have ever experienced in Singapore - terrible service and rude staff.

Clean and quiet place. Service staff was polite and professional. Went there on a promo which was pretty worth it. They seem to have some GSS sale going on right now too.

My therapist was very attentive to my needs throughout the session. She made sure I was comfortable with the pressure applied and even picked up my sudden itchiness at my foot and helped me to scratch so that I can be as relaxed as possible.
