My masseur was John and like many of the praises for him here, i too had a wonderful experience. John did not really ask me of my pain/sore areas but he somehow managed to hit all of them and i felt so relaxed afterwards. Totally recommend the full body massage because his skills are divine!

The place is very clean and not shady at all,  lady boss was very friendly and welcoming as well! Will visit again soon.

I have always been booking Anna for the full body massage.
These days when I call, whenever the male guy picks up.
I think his name is John.. this rude person always telling me that Anna is not free or not working today.. recommends to book Amy or Ammie? I don't know what name it is, but really rude. And when I walk in with my husband that day into the store, Anna was free to massage me. This is so unprofessional!

As suggested by everyone here, I tried this place because my legs are aching and I cannot walk properly. John was my therapist, He is very professional the pressure is spot on and the massage technique was really good. Although it is painful, I felt good and relax at the end. Must try! This is the first time Im leaving a good review

I booked a one and half hour body massage by John. Very courteous and modest person. He asked where my aches and pain points were and he went about unhurriedly with his craft, giving more attention to the areas I pointed out. Overall he could moderate the pressure throughout the session and this is a clear sign of a very skilled masseur. My full endorsement to his skill and professionalism.

Did a last minute booking for a 2-hour full body massage at 6 pm. Was served by John and the massage was strong and able to relieve the pain and aches accumulated over the week. Felt refreshed after the massage. Place is easy to reach, with good ambience. Will definitely go back again.

This place is a great value for money.  I have been visiting for foot massage on weekly basis. The shop is clean and the staffs are skillful! Need to call to check availability, especially weekend to avoid waiting onsite or get turned down.
