I always receive very good and consistently strong massages by the therapists here.  I first started coming for one hour massages but found it was a bit rushed and they could only focus on my back.  I now come for the 90 minute or 120 minute massage and now get a great relaxing massage, and feel completely refreshed afterwards.  Excellent place to enjoy a quality massage at a reasonable price.  Recommended for everyonethey also have a room for couples and I have come here together with my spouse as well.

Probably one of the worst massages I have had. The masseuse didn't speak English - which is the norm for cheap massage places because owners value profits over service to non-chinese in Singapore (but I will not expound on the hypocrisy of this in my supposedly harmonious racially diverse country), but that aside, the masseuse either did not use enough pressure or too much, with no in-between.  She also massaged my face with her bare hands, which demonstrates poor hygiene. Most professional places use towels placed over their customers' head and face. I had to tell the masseuse to stop touching my face. She then proceeded to 'massage' my head, but she spent most of her time scratching my scalp. This totally grossed me out and I ended the massage at that point.

There is also an inappropriate lack of privacy (see attached photo) . Anyone walking by your cubicle will be able to see you changing or getting massaged thanks to the clear glass panel in the door!

Skip this place. You're better off paying a bit more for a more enjoyable, and professional experience

The place was supposed to close at 10.30pm but we reached at 9.50pm and they were able to accommodate us for a 1-hr massage! Ladies did a great job. They were considerate to let us rest as much as we can. Was in my pants and was offered to change into disposable shorts too. Will visit again!

If you are looking for privacy - THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU.
Had very weird expirence which the messeur kept the door of the room half open.
I've never been in a place which someone can pass by and see you easily during a massage.
Very creepy and strange. I hope they will change  it for future customers.

Nearby to where we live and work, so this is a convenient pop-in massage place when I suffer from tension headaches. The most important things for any massage parlour (to me anyway) is cleanliness and quality of massage. Tree House Spa ticks both of these boxes, its clean, and the massage is consistently good. I have been going here on and off for nearly 2 years now and would recommend it to others.

Came across this place for an early night massage. My partner and I ordered a couples room, which we got with no problems. Staff were great and the massages were perfect and just what we needed. The facilities might seem a bit dated compared to high-end type places but price was much cheaper than most of the local spots around the Orchard Rd area (where we were staying). Good value for money.

The BEST massage place in Singapore for only S$ 50 for FULL 60 mins. The rooms are clean, the massage beds and towels smell fresh and they also offer couple room. I have been a regular for just over a year now, I love how professional the ladies are. They are super experienced and knowledgable, I often go there with different complains, such as tension related headaches, shoulder aches from caring my baby or aching muscles from exercising. They would always know what to do to target those troubled areas. Excellent services!

Very good place. Came here spontaneous, cause of a pain in the neck. Had a 60 min Massage. It is a strong massage, but my back is so tensed that it desperately needed to be smoothed from tissue to top.
For sure I will have some muscle ache the coming days, but the tense already feels much better!
Will come back!

Visited few times, I continued to enjoy the outstanding massages from different masseuse of this spa. Some maybe slightly better than others, but all rated 4 to 5 stars. Serious and genuine, most of them came with experience and knowledge in Chinese tui-na (), so when combine with aromatheraphatic, the massage became fantastic. Especially the focusing on my back lower spine was excellent, erasing all pain and tiredness... the place may not be lavish, but clean and neat, and all rooms with attached bath. Most important is the price... very reasonable.

Booked a massage at 11.00am for this afternoon. Called 25mins before massage is due to say they can no longer do it as another customer extended their booking and to change the booking to Saturday. Poor service.

i did upper back for 30 mins with Tina today, Aug 2019. She knew i had tensed shoulder without me telling her and she did her best to loosen the tension in the muscles. Within that 30 mins i went in and out of sleep without me realizing. The best massage I've ever had in my 29 years in this planet. do look for her if you are visiting. I am not sure about others but she will be my go to person anytime. Thanks Tina!!

Visited this new spa along River Valley Road next to Oxley Edge/ opposite Aspen Heights a few times, probably the best around this area. Young and cheerful genuine experienced masseuse leading you into clean and cosy rooms with soft music, all with attached bath. Appreciate their efforts to keep the place organized and well lit. Importantly the masseuse is never rushing for time, even with a bit of overrun.

(Translated by Google) Tree house spa is a gem in big city. I dropped by without expecting but it was made me chill and relaxed a lot. 40 SGD for one hour foot massage is reasonable but I guarantee the experience you get will be more than that price!
It passed by and happened to enter, but it was wider and beautiful than expected! The staff's skill was good, and I slowly pushed firmly one by one, and I fell into sleep immediately. It was good to receive the service more than the price!

(Translated by Google) I visit here almost every weekend since I think here is the best massage place in Asia. They do finger pressured and oil treatment at the same time. Both ways are nice. And the massagers are well trained. You no need to digignate one. Doing Great. / I go every weekend. Because it's very good. With the combination of acupressure and oil, the oil is applied for a longer time, but it works pinpointly. The quality is good for all treatments.

(Translated by Google) Hello @sam wong! I am YOYO, I don't know if you can read Chinese characters. I want to ask you one thing. When did you come to the tree house spa massage? Under what circumstances did I ask you that question? I asked myself if I haven't done these things. Because you were a comment made last week. And I also checked the registration in our store and didn't see your record. I am a regular massage. I want to work long hours instead of doing it. I will return to China in a few days. Because I can't talk, I rarely talk to guests when I work. In addition to asking if I want to add a clock, I haven't been very fluent in English for a long time. If it is not the boss, ask me. I still don't understand these. Or do you say that I am offending you, our store is a regular massage, or we will not be affirmed!
