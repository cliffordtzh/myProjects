I dont say this lightly but this is the best massage Ive ever had in Singapore. Masseurs here are incredibly skilled and Ill definitely be back. As the saying goes, Felt like Ive got a new back

A very relaxing place. Cheap and affordable. Look for June, a Chinese lady, she did a great job! Will come back again. Sure!

My massuer was alright. But it was damn noisy. The place looks like a Thai massage place but it didn't have the Thai polite and peaceful culture. This place is run by Malaysian Chinese and they speak loudly making the entire experience a pain. They do not understand the meaning of total relaxation which we all go for. Hence it is a Malaysian business but faking to be a Thai massage parlour.

Honestly one of the better massage places I've been to. The 90mins full body massage goes for $70 which is really competitive in terms of pricing.

The massuers I had for the last 2 visits though different but both gave a very good deep Thai styled massage.

Came here without checking the reviews cos my friend said its top 3 Thai massage palour in Sg. I had hands down the WORST experience ever! My masseur is a China Chinese. I have no words to describe how bad her skills are. If they continue using this woman, this shop should just cease to operate! 1 hour of Thai massage felt like Im being tortured. Shes pressing my bones , no cracking of my bones thankfully else I think she will probably dislocate them instead of relieving any pain/stress that I have. Geez!!!! Never had such bad massage ever in Sg!

reservation was good, reception friendly and the place is clean. My therapist was clumsy and rough though. I asked several times to not do something and yet she kept doing the same. It was more stomping and pinching than massage ... my girlfriend who was next to me was quite happy about her therapist though, nevertheless i will not return here.

Affordable foot massage and experienced massage therapist! 2nd visit, and they did not disappoint. Fixed all the aches in my feet and they definitely do not play when it comes to strength. If you're expecting fancy spa music with top tier service, this is not the place. But if you just want to get the job done with friendly staff then yes, I will reccomend this spot :)

Not for fussy customers,  for example massage bed is on floor. Simple deco,  clean and because I found a masseur who is very patient & good to locate pain spots,  I continue to go!

Professional, clean and authentic thai massages. It's really affordable too. I come here regularly for massages for sport-induced muscle soreness. Highly recommended.

Update: Went for a full body massage and the masseuse kept kneading directly on my bones despite telling her it really hurts. I was wincing throughout the whole session. Now my entire back and arms hurts from the massage. Disappointed!

The volume of employees talking and looking at their mobile phones is too loud, completely disregarding customers' feelings.

Good place for a pain relieving massage. This place relieved my long-term neck and back pain. Pit-fall, they speak very little English. Nonetheless, highly recommended.

No frills sort of place, but the masseurs all mean business. If you need a good (completely monkey business-free) pounding and ironing out, this is the place to get it. If you're the fragile sort that needs gentle handling, don't try your luck.

nice no-nonsense place, very tough massage, but sometimes thats exactly what you need, they got the skills. Place in the back for a shower is ok, but the steam bath was just a hot damp room.

(Translated by Google) Been to so many massage shops, this is the best technology! According to a Malaysian master, travel to Singapore, tired, can not do, 30 minutes plus 40 minutes of pedicure 50 SGD, completely resurrected! I will come back to Singapore next time.
