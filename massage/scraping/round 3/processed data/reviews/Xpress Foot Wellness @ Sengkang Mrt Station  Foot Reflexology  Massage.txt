Staff are well trained and provide good massage skill.

You can never enjoy a proper massage here. Masseuse keeps talking with other staffs so loudly. And chats up the customers non stop. You can tell that the customers does not really want to chat either. When customers falls asleep, they will just piano massage no more effort. You know what I mean. I guess I'm right. The other reviews here says likewise.

Great massage and I highly recommend. The foot and back massage was amazing. The therapist is able to accommodate to our request as we request more to deep pressure massage.

Very cosy & clean reflexology place. 1st time visit the place since its convenient at Sengkang mrt. The staff are friendly, registration was easy. The lady massues named CANDY was petite but very strong hands, slow & steady each she applies pressure on every stroke. Definitely will choose her again

The lady therapist massage strength is good.
Tried Katty and Linda both are good. My parents are really satisfied after the massage.
Place was clean and nice they change and clean the seat after another customer.

Both staffs and customers talking loudly. No peace and do really enjoy my experience anymore. It used to be a great cozy place to relax after work. This place is like a marketplace now.

Was quite a nice place for very decent massage, gave it 5 stars. sadly the recent visit has not been pleasant. The employees were talking and joking to each other loudly and not paying much attention to the massage.

The masseurs generally have good techniques and are willing to adjust accordingly to the customer's request.

However, they tend to talk very loudly amongst themselves a lot even while attending to different people (e.g. talking about their earnings for the day, or the customers they had) at the customer service areas. Would also be better if they change the towels after each use as we noticed that they do tend to fold it back after use for the next customer on different occasions.

I like the masseurs (female ones) here as they use the right amount of strength for massage.  The price is ok.  Not exactly cheap nor too expensive.  Cannot compare to the cheaper price overseas of course.

Im disappointed on my recent visit.  They arranged a male masseur to massage for me without informing me.  I was shocked - I booked combo package of 40 mins foot and 40 mins back.  I told the receptionist that I only wanted a female masseur, and she argued that I never requested for a female one.  What kind of service is this?

The receptionist - by the name of Stella, should have asked me over the phone if I am ok with a male masseur before booking.  I had been here twice and they always gotten a female to massage for me.  I have no idea that a male masseur will also massage for female customers.

In the end, for a female one, I can only go for 60 mins foot/back.

Not all female customers will be comfortable with a male masseur, and the receptionist ought to check with them before booking for them.  I do hope the owner can train the receptionist to be more sensitive.
