Staff is friendly, kind and patient. I would highly recommend this place! They don't try to upsell and are very accommodating. Massage is excellent as well.

Great and consistent pressure applied and i left feeling like well kneaded dough. I almost fell asleep!

Someone previously left a review saying they were bothered by the staff chatting with each other while massaging. This doesn't bother me at all and doesn't take away from the fact that the masseuse is excellent. I could care less that she's chatting away during a 2hr massage as long as she gets my kinks out.

Will  be back!

I hope they stick around for awhile!

decided to come here after seeing a friend's igstory about how this is her monthly go-to. first time doing a full body thai massage and first time here as well. opted for 60mins with oil, paid $54. had a lovely experience and i think this is going to become my go-to for full body thai massage as well hehe. fuss-free, good vibes, warm staff, clean and cozy, friendly and skilled masseur. hurt a little here and there because my shoulders/neck/upper back is/are really quite tight, but a good amount of strength was used. nothing too unbearable. keep it up!!!! :>

Thoroughly enjoyed a fantastic oil massage - $78 for 90 mins - by Nat. She applied consistent pressure and assured technique. 100% recommended for physically active folks who have hip/lower back aches. You feel like youre transported back to Bangkok with the Thai music as well.  Great value and experience. Will definitely be back.

Seriously this is one of the best Thai massage you can find in Singapore.

From feeling sluggish, heavy and aching, all my shoulder ache and pain were gone within that 1 hour body massage session (highly recommend with oil) Coco really know how to find the point that is causing the ache and use her skills and pressure to get rid of it.

Seriously rather than medicine, sometimes all you need is one good Thai massage session. Highly recommend!

Made a booking via whatsapp and came down to this shop without much expectation because I just wanted a simple massage to ease up all those tension after working from home for too long. Arrived way earlier before my appointment time and from the shop front, it seemed like a small unassuming shop operated by a few aunties.

Saw a lady sitting outside the shop and told her that I am early for my appointment but she mentioned that it's fine and allowed me to proceed in anyway. Turned out that she (Coco) is actually the owner of the shop. Massage was superb and felt much better than what I paid for. I added another $10 to try out cupping and Coco made me comfortable while also explaining the benefits to me.

The walls are paper thin and the masseurs talk to each other quite a lot during the massage session, so if noise troubles you then this might not be the place for you, but if you are looking for a good authentic solid Thai massage, then you found just the right place.

Strong massage given by Coco herself - comfortable experience and really felt she put the perfect amount of pressure to remove the kinks, especially in my shoulders. Cracking at the end was an interesting touch as well. Highly recommend

Stumbled upon this hidden gem.
I opted for traditional massage 1hour @ $49(Aug National day promo)

Masseuse Min was very friendly and skilled!!
She also constantly checked if I was ok with the pressure
Lots of cracking and stretching.
Really enjoyed my session with her , all the tension in my body was released felt like a new born lol.

Don't expect high class spa pattern ,
this is your no frills super authentic thai massage.
A little bit of happy chatter here and there but overall positive vibe.
Better to call for appointment as they have limited space.

So glad I found this place, already looking forward to my next visit!

Highly recommended Thai massage. Better than the massages I've had in Thailand or jb (Bangkok Spa and some others)

So far, I've always asked for Joy. V controlled pressure and she does the cracking well. Helping to share cos business hasn't been good due to covid and they're having an offer till end august. 49 for 1 hour oil massage.

Do not be deceived by its unassuming appearance :D even though it may not look grand, the staff are very skilled and they get the job well done. Fuss free. Warm and happy staff. Good pricing. Ache was gone and I could lift up my head again after the massage. Will visit again!

First time trying this place out. I called to make an appointment for the same day and was accommodated accordingly. Went with the 1 hour oiled massage at $54. The rooms were extremely dark and housed in makeshift rooms of plywood walls and curtains. The masseuse all talked amongst one another over the curtains but it wasnt a big deal because they were all having a good time, plus it didnt jeopardize the massage itself.

The massage itself felt SO good. Pressure was consistent throughout the entire massage. At the end, the lady cracked my back and neck and released literally years of built up tension. It was SO loud we both were a bit shocked and laughed. I was offered warm water after. 100% would recommend!

Note: They dont accept visa or AMEX. Only cash, grabpay or paynow.

Massage is ok but masseurs kept talking in Thai among themselves across the rooms and masseur kept going out to pick up ringing shop phone. Frustrating and irritating.

No frills, reasonable price and good service. The massage therapist (didn't get her name) was very good with maintaining her strength. Always had very stiff neck and shoulder, but the 1 hour session was excellent. I had communicated to her about my desire to focus more on my neck and shoulders and she did focus on these areas unlike other places I have been to.

It was also fairly easy to get a slot (Monday afternoon). But do call in advance to check with them! Overall very pleased with the service provided. Will definitely return again!

This no-frills massage spot is a hidden gem! The massage therapists are from Thailand and they specialise in authentic Thai-style massage, which will sort out your pesky knots and tight muscles. Lady boss Coco was my therapist and I fully recommend her for her perfect pressure and expert hands. My hour-long session was painful but worth it as I felt much more relaxed after. Booking via Facebook was very easy too!

I've had chronic backaches for the last 12 years ever since my Scoliosis operation. Been to many massage parlours everywhere - Sg, Msia, Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia... in hopes of getting my stubborn knots (esp neck, shoulders & back) sorted.
>Comms - Fb messaged on Xmas eve to book a slot for 2pax. Got prompt replies by early the next morning and was scheduled a slot on Xmas day.
>Ambience - Looks a little shady from the outside. 6 beds avail, separated by curtains. No sound proofing so you can hear all the masseurs chatting in Thai throughout, but it adds to the feel I guess. Coupled with Thai music playing softly, I really thought I was in Bkk.
>Skills - Linda was amazingly strong and thorough. She acknowledged that my back was problematic but persisted in pressing the knotty areas. Linda has been there for 10yrs, so she was definitely pretty pro. Hands-down one of the BEST massage sessions (wanted 1.5hr but was only given 1hr as they were gonna close early on PH). 200% CONFIRM GOING BACK. GO TRY IT YOURSELF :D

Massaue name LINDA is very skillful. She is a very experienced and skillful maassaue who provides very good massage. Unlike other massaues that you will feel pain after the session. She is very well versed in her technic to give our tired body a nice relax massage. Highly recommend to you, worth every penny spent.
