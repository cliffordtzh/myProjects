New shop name is Master of Massage. Staff are friendly and courteous.

Foot reflexology is $45 for 60mins (includes 10mins of head & shoulder)

Foot + Body is $50 for 60mins.

My friends choose the foot reflexology which comes with a foot bath and had their treatments done on sitting chair, whereas i had body + foot and was lead into a massage room.

They provide a pair of disposable shorts for massage and I choose to have no oil for body massage, the therapist is quite strong with her strokes and it gets abit unbearable. After my body massage, i had my foot reflexology on the bed without any foot wash and it makes me feel uncomfortable. The head pillow also smelled n i had used a towel to go over it.

Personally feel their hygiene practices can be improved.

(Translated by Google) I felt very tired after get off work last night. I found a new massage shop here. I tried to massage it too much. As a result, the masseur was very good and massaged for an hour, and I will come again in the future.
