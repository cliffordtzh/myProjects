I love this massage center and I always went here whenever I feel dizzy and tired. I love the facilitation and how professional they are on their work. The reception is impressive and responds very fast. I recommend this massage center because they are very accommodating and loving the area because it is organized. They deserve a five-star rating.

I love this place and I always went here whenever I feel stress at work. I think the staff of this massage parlor already knows me since I visit this place two or three times every month. The staff who massage me frequently is professional and really knows which spot at my back feels great tension. They deserve a five-star rating.

impressive experience !  The reception respond quickly, and the therapist came in short time. Tina is an excellent therapist with her amazing hands.  It was the most comfortable service I have ever had. Bravo!!  Anybody who is interested in tantric massage should order her service.

Singapore being the Asia regional hub, I've heard of highly skilled massage service here. Having said that, I was not disappointed with Chakra tantra massage, the lady is experienced. The only complain I have is she's late for 35 minutes, which is a long wait for me, but acceptable due to the heavy traffic at 6pm.

It was awesome experience with Chakra Tantra Massage Singapore. Chakra Tantra Massage is a true outcall knead in Singapore. When I were in Singapore I utilized their administration. I got more than I anticipated. Worth each penny and doubtlessly I will return once more!!

Tantric sensual massage, when it is done well, it is one of the real happy things in life. There are many versions of tantric massage depending from the country and also the company. I had a happy time with the girl from Chakra Tantra massage.
