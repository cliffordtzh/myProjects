The masseur Anne is so patient and professional. Communicated with me where I feel pain and applied pressure at the right spot.

Receptionist friendly and I really like how this place is fuss-free and no persuasion to sign on any package at all.

Such a pleasant experience.

Will be back!

I asked for back massage but the male massager called Brian said my shoulder stiff and only massage neck and shoulder. No hand, arm and he tapped back few times only. I have a problem with my back so I wanted back massage.  I wanted to complain but because there is next appointment no time.

Chance upon this place. My therapist is Qingyun. He is knowledgeable and accurate on pressure points. Also tried body massage and feel refreshed at the end of the session.

Had been having a stiff neck for a few days and went for an upper back + foot reflexology combo. Qingyun was my masseuse . I felt so much better and found myself naturally sitting up straight after his massage. I like very strong massages and he definately has the strength. He was also very caring and gave tips/reminders on my posture. Thumbs up.

Just ended my 1 hour body massage. All the way that masseuse was using his elboy and there is no oil at all. I thought there is cos usually they will use right? All the way massage my body but there is no massage on the legs or at all. Wasted my 58$ for a 1 hour session. Will definitely not recommend this to other people in the future. Sorry

Acrually I recommend Qingyun to my friend based on Google review but I have yet to try.  Tried his services yesterday and had a good sleep.  Had bad headache and somehow it was gone by after foot reflexology.  Hmm will go out again for his services.

My first visit to this outlet and I love the environment and very relaxing. I would highly recommend this outlet and my masseur is Qing Yun from China and he is very friendly and professional in his skills and services. One of the best foot masseur I've tried. I will definitely back again. Thank you

Poor service. I pay for 1 hour for a full oil massage and not even a single oil was being used during the session. Massage should be using hand and this guy from the start until the session ended, he using elbow to press on my body until my body feel so painful after the massage.

I called their number to book an hour long appointment at 1145am.

I reached at 1140am, and was caught by surprise when the counter lady told me that my massage will only start at 12pm as she saw a mistake in the booking timings. I told her that I could not take an hour starting from 12pm as my son finishes his playgroup session at 1245pm. I think it's only a professional courtesy to notify me in advance on her mistake, not when I've already arrived at their door step and after making payment.

The franchise's only saving grace: She did offer me to take up 40 minute massage instead of an hour and gave me back a refund.

Had a bad massage done by Ann. Supposed to be a full body massage but she did my back only didn't cover my front and when asked she said she wasn't aware. Full body suppose to be full body and not just the back. Her massage was poorly done too till I asked her to use strength. Sorry basically a lifeless chicken doing massage. I didn't want to say anything I just paid the full price which wasn't even worth it. I have done massage here with other masuese without any complaints.

This was my first time getting foot reflexology. Frankly, it was quite painful. I never expected the foot massage this way. But the therapist told me i will feel netter
After completing the massage, my feet were feeling very light and numb.
As it was my first time, i can't compare it or  call it good or bad.
The ambience was good, the staff was friendly.

Was surprised to discover this massage place which is so near my house. Massage was good and on point. I think my masseur was Lisa, and my friend's was Anne. I'll definitely come back again.

Been here a few times and only once was the foot massage slightly above average. The rest were poor to average. The therapists are weak and gave soft massage even when told be harder.

Despite booking an appointment an hour before the massage they managed to gave me a slot . The person who was helping me to do the massage was also really awesome cant remember her name but she was the one who helped me with a body massage and she was so considerate throughout the massage session and she made sure she got all the spots where I was feeling really sore and she even asked if I was cold and I said yes , she went on to get another blanket/ towel to cover my body  . Would go back again  ( for the same lady )

Despite I'm late for my appointment on last sunday the staff counter lady was so nice to slot me in and push another booking to a later slot.  Really appreciate that so i decided to write a review for your company. Staff was friendly and the therapist was good even give me some health tips. Had a really wonderful massage. Thanks for the service.

Was told on the phone and via whatsapp theyll do prenatal massages even at 9 months pregnant. Than when trying to book they said no due to fear of complications. Sorry, but you guys are not doctors and I wouldnt be trying to book a massage if my doctor wasnt okay with it. Shouldnt tell customers yes and then change minds.

Hidden find! Clean and quiet.

A friend recommended Rose and I was so glad that I had her as my masseur. just finished an hour foot and 40 mins body. The pressure was on point. You dont even need to tell her where your pain points are. If you need a fix, she is the go to person. Would be back for more!!

Recently I had back to back events at my workplacr that required lots of movement..from it my back and leg were super sore and needed massage..

I went for Combo Foot and Back 40 mins each and attended by masseuse Yoyo.

The session went superbly great and my body felt light... n my feet felt good too!

2 weeks after I had tired leg n neck, shoulders.... i booked Yoyo again and she did wonders!

thank u Yoyo and I shall meet and hv u again!

(Translated by Google) I personally like the staff service of this massage shop. I also recommend the man named qing yun. He explained my problems when he massaged my feet and pressed my sore acupoints forcefully without taking my time. , I dont like some massage parlors who take my time and help me press freely. I am very satisfied with the staff here. He is very dedicated to help me massage my feet. I am very grateful to qing yun for helping me solve my problem, and I will ask my friends to request his service next time. Really good
