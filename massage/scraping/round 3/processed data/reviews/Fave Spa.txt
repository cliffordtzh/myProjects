Took a grab here in a rush as I was afraid that I would be late. Arrived early but had to wait for my appointment timing. Was greeted by the front-desk manager. Place is cosy, clean and very private. Small little cosy front shop that opens up to many rooms inside. My therapist Chloe was very friendly,  very polite and had very soothing hands. All in all a very relaxing massage.

Hi. Firstly, The place really lives up to its name. I would like compliment one of the therapist. I had a Hot Oil Massage session with Isha on New Year's Day at 8pm. All i can say is she is great at what she is doing. She can sense that my body was super tense and she just knew how much pressure to apply and what technique to use. She even managed to resolve the problem i had with my right shoulder. I would definitely come back for more sessions at Fave Spa.

Had a appointment with therapist Paris. She is a very pleasant, cheerful and polite girl that always served with a smile. During the massage, she is very efficient, professional and hardworking. She ensure me by constantly asking me whether everything was okay and I was very well being taken care of. I was actually wowed by skills despite her youth. Overall, I would have rated her above 5 stars if have the selection.

 Brenda *****Highly recommended to get your massage from Brenda. 5 Star for her massage, she is experienced and knows where are the meridian point on my back, neck and shoulder for fatigue releasing and body relaxing. Feeling refresh and stress free after the massage. Will have a good night sleep tonight and keep fighting for another day.
Definitely will come back again to find Brenda. Not to mention the receptionist is very polite and accommodating as well when I'm waiting. I think Fave spa have done so much to ensure all customer will have a pleasant and safe time while enjoying the massage there. Cheeersss!

Had been visiting Fave Spa for quite some time was always welcomed warmly by the friendly receptionist, Kelly. Place is very clean and cosy too.

Mandy is one of the massage therapist there and is my go-to massage therapist, her skills are definitely one of the best. She would constantly ask if pressure applied is ok and focus on areas that requires more attention.

Overall, i would definitely recommend Fave Spa to anyone who wants to have a relaxed and enjoyable time.

Revisited Fave spa had a Vietnamese therapist, was an very displeasing experience this time. The masseuse was in her own zone, kept working my back again and again the same spots for 50+ mins low skills. When it came to legs seemed to try rush by did not care much on taking feedback.. 0 communication and absolutely was an opposite to the experience prior with Cherrie. Due to the lack of consistency and a bad massage on a day when I needed it the most. Changing my review to 2 stars.

Had a massage yesterday from Cherry around 5.30 pm. She was excellent in providing a massage as well as to small talk making the whole experience comfortable & relaxing. Fave center was very diligent with the cleanliness standards considering the CV19 situation so thank you for that and keep up the great work :)

If you choose 58$ Full body 1 hour massage package they will ask you to buy 89$ 1 hour full body massage and in 58$ They will give you massage using towel and its also not full body massage . Also they will not provide you one time disposable underwear but give you someones used underwear which they might have washed last night ... come on used underwear??? So advice you guys to bring your own disposable underwear before you visit

Had an appointment with Brenda at 5pm ,  Brenda was perfect and spot on with the points that needed loosening, i'm also glad that she managed to put me to sleep for a good 15mins, which rarely happens.

She's very friendly and chatty during the session which i'm comfortable with as most masseur do not even communicate with you during the session.

Will recommend friends to the place and Brenda is highly recommended as well! keep up the good work!

Bad receptionist.  I called at 2 to make appointment at 3 today.  Got to the place at 3 and the receptionist said she didn't have me down for an appointment and nothing is available.   So I start question on who took the call and I showed them that I called and ask for a solution.. instead all she said is with an attitude that I already told you I'm sorry but there is nothing she can do.. the next slot is at 4:30 ... First of all, it's not my problem that you made a mistake of not writing down called in appointment requests and taking other customer.  And second instead of offering ways to make up the time I took to get over there.  All the reception did was said  well I already told you I'm sorry what else you want me to do.    I've had massage there before and is good but the receptionist attitude is extremely bad...    A good way of doing business would prob be saying that  let me book your appointment for 4:30 and take 10 15% off or something..  nothing.. simply said nothing right now  and nothing she can do..    you just lost a customer...

Very disappointed with the staff in bedok branch. I went there with my son in law who is British n fixed an appointment for him.  She said ok n took down details. Made appointment for 17th today at 9am.  When he went at 9am a different girl at the reception Said they do only for sporeans.  What Rubbish!!!!!
My son in law came back n told me.  I tot it was some miscommunication.  I than went to Fave Spa and spoke to the china girl who told me the same thing in broken English which I managed to grasp.
You should educate your staff on terms and conditions.  They seem to have their own rules and regulations.
I also asked them where is your boss. And they all said 'dont know never come to shop. So never see"

Strange.
-------------------------------------

I tried calling the number but the girl said owner not in.  She put me to the manager who couldn't speak English. So I left my contact wth the reception.

Anyway is it true that Fave Spa is for sporeans Only.
