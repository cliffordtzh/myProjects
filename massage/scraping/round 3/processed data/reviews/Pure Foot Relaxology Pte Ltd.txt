Went there for foot reflexology+ back massage upon seeing the good reviews 2 weeks ago. So tot lets give it a shot. Service crew were very friendly and professional. However, the big toe on my right foot has been numb since my visit. Now im comtemplating should I go to the doctor or go back to have them checked what went wrong. My foot has been feeling weird since and I never had such sensation before ever. And Im beginning to feel worried if the nerve is damaged at that area.. Sigh..

What an amazing gem of a place! Was in the area passing by but had stopped to have a look inside as the place just screamed comfort! Massive comfy seats with a big LED TV screen whilst having a foot massage?! Had a try out of interest and boy was it a good idea. I highly recommend the deep tissue massage and the foot massage thereafter.

I have been to many places like these before but the level of expertise and service from each member of staff was exceptionally good.

I cannot stress how highly I would recommend to anyone to try and I assure you would be feeling as amazing as I did when I left.

Amazing experience! I've been to many massage parlours but this has to be the best I've been to in Singapore so far. My masseur was really skilled (told me he's been doing it for more than 10 years in Singapore). Pretty new setup as they just opened at the start of 2020. If you choose a foot massage, you'll get plush comfy chairs with individual screen and wireless headset to watch movies. My friend who did it with me thoroughly enjoyed his experience too. Plus it's affordable and customer service is top-notch too. Cannot recommend this place enough!

had a tense week and needed a massage desperately. found this unassuming looking shop and popped in. totally glad that i did it as my masseur was very professional and thorough, eliminating all my knots and fatigue. i started with 1 hour, but increased another 30 mins halfway through my massage.   i felt like a brand new person when i stepped out!  and oh, the place was very clean and the massage chair was so so comfy!

Such an amazing place to get a foot massage.. Surprisingly affordable and highly skilled masseuses.  And you watch movies on the touchscreen panel in front you while you get massaged.
