Tried this massage down my block over the weekend.

Place is neat, clean and smells good. Danny is polite and soft-spoken. This is where the "positives" end.

Gaps: Massage lacks strength and techniques. Rather random and aimless. Massage style is "piano" type, soft touch. On top of this, the session ended about 10mins earlier than stipulated time. Only realized after i paid the cash and left.....

Very disappointing experience

Danny was very friendly and patient. He massages well and got rid of all those "knots" out of me! I would recommend his place for a good and affordable massage.

Went without expectation but was honestly pleasantly surprised! Owner was very friendly and the massage was great. His pressure is perfect for me and I definitely felt better when it was done. The place is really clean and cosy. Will definitely be back again :)

Didnt expect much from a small neighbourhood massage place but it turned out one of the best experiences Ive had so far! The masseur / owner was very skilful and friendly. Throughout my 40 mins back and shoulder massage, the pressure force was consistent and on point. I always have sore lower back due to prolonged sitting, but it feels very relieved after the session. Highly recommended and definitely will be back again!

Clean and professional outfit that offers great massages at a reasonable price. Owner is a friendly chap that knows when to make small talk and when to give the customer space. Would definitely recommend.

(Translated by Google) The location is easy to find, close to Bishan subway station, and the owner is also very nice. People are very easy-going and easy to chat! What surprised me was that the owner turned out to be a Singaporean who loves freedom! The shop is very quiet, so the owner will do it himself! The surrounding environment is also very relaxing, and the technology is also great! Will go again when I have time!
