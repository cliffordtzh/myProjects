Their authentic thai massage fully relaxes the whole body and provides calmness and peace of mind to tackle the routine challenges of the next day. I have tried all of the young service providers and there was never a dull moment in each and every unique and pleasurable experience they make you feel. No doubt about it's fit for a king!

Came here for 1.5hours thai massage, masseur was Tina. She's very professional and will check if I'm OK or if the strength is ok. She is very skillful and have equal strength for both hands. Great Thai massage in Sg!

Dropped in here in the evening for a 60 min neck and back massage. It was excellent! I guess it was Thai style massage as I'm not used to being moved around a bit more, but I felt quite relaxed afterwards. Will definitely be back!

I love it! If you are craving for an authentic traditional Thai massage, this is your go to place. They have unique techniques that Is similar to what you would experienced in Thailand. Sarah did a great job and I will definitely return back for her. I was given a private room for full body massage. The room amenities and toilet was also very clean.

As a veritable massage connoisseur - my GF and I go once per week on the whole and weve been here ten years!! - I can say this is pound-for-pound best massage for us both. Super comfy and relaxed floor level beds, well air conditioned, airy, clean massage rooms to wind down in (theyve avoided those grimey huge chairs or massage tables + face hole that most others opt for that makes the rooms feeL stagnant and overused). Importantly TALENTED masseuse that have obviously had good training and not just going through motions, really take care to make you feel relaxed. Super friendly service always seem to manage to fit us in to our preferred timings.

I went for Traditional Thai massage today at Healthland Pte Ltd. This is by far the best Thai massage place I've experienced in Singapore. Good clean place, strong hands massage & very polite girls. Overall value for money. Reasonable price. Must visit

Not sure whether it's related to the healthland in Thailand but the Masseur  I got is good! She used a number of techniques and really loosen up my muscles.

Only drawback is that while it is  more expensive than usual, you still have to share the room with 2 other customers. I couldn't really rest well due to a snoring customer next to me.

Nice little place in the heart of Chinatown. Went with my 3 friends on Sunday, 16/8/2020 - 5 PM. Do remember to give them a call for an appointment prior to arrival. Otherwise, you may have to wait for a time slot.
Masseurs were very well-versed in their massage, slightly different variation of your regular Thai massage which I really really appreciate. They target core areas like your legs and especially your back. They are also able to converse in both English and Mandarin. Room is basic but extremely clean with frequent sanitization. Bang for your buck. I will definitely return again if I need to release the knots in my body.

Best Thai massage I've ever had. Better than any I've had in Thailand, even a place I was brought to by a local friend in Bangkok. They really know what they're doing. Absolutely amazing. Couldn't recommend it more. They also have a really soft bed to lay on. The price is good and the facilities are really nice too.

Very unique way of massaging. Loved it. Although I wish they included hands massage in the full body massage. I felt like that was missing for a complete session. Also please be careful sometimes lower back area too much pressure is added. Otherwise I loved it!

They are very clean, very tidy. Give you new quality mask at arrival and departure. Cleanse your hands, spray the room, stairs, guide rail at your departure. Malaysian did Thai massage better, more expert than all thai i met in Singapore, Thai main cities.

I read the reviews beforehand. But wow! So happy to have picked this place. Its calming and relaxing as soon as you walk in. Staff are very professional. The massages are incredible (cheapest option is 60 min Thai for $60). It was so worth it!

Think Ill be back every week for a treat. Thanks again! 10/10

Did leg massage, the masseur was really distracted with the other customers and colleague, therefore ended up the same technique used was really repetitive and overused.

Other than that, the atmosphere and coziness was not bad. I would recommend the body massage instead of their leg massage.

There is nothing wrong with the place but massage was the worst I have ever had. I do a lot of messages but here I had to walk out. I allowed 40 min but then could not handle any more. Sweaty hands, no technique, no energy, no effort. I had zero affect on sore muscles. Clearly here they dont train staff, dont hire people who love and understand their profession and basically get away with customers who just like any massage.
I was fully refunded so was treated fairly and with respect. It is possible that I was unlucky with a particular therapist but I doubt.

They are not accepting with skin disease like PSORIASIS.They will turn you down and decline your appointment. They have no experience handling people with NON CONTAGIOUS SKIN PROBLEMS.They have atleast several good  massage therapist but not highly educated of who shall not to massage or massage. So, watch out if you have rashes, etc. They will let you feel discriminated.

I always go to thai massage when I have pain from doing intense sports. This time I went for knee pain. Any injury needs specific treatment and a good professional knows how to treat it. This time I got a regular massage, the exact same one as my wife next to me (she went fior relaxing massage). When I mentioned after a while that she nees to work on the trigger points that cause my pain she just said everything fine with your knee.

Receptionist with poor integrity and no concern for female customer's privacy.

Went in at 5pm on 7 Dec for a Thai massage and was asked to change in a store room. I was then led to a room with about 3-4 beds with no curtain partitions. I had been to heathland regularly over the last 2 years and always get a private room to myself. This was the usual practice for female customers and the common rooms were used mainly for male customers. Obviously I was shocked and I asked if they would expect more customers and if there may be male customers sharing the room. Yes was the answer to both qns. Obviously this was not what I am comfortable with (the top was just tied with a string and often come loose during massages). Then I asked why there was no mention of it when I was paying. They just said oh we are full if you want a private room you have to wait.

What really gets me is that there is no mention of all this at the counter, before payment so that I could make an informed decision.
So I asked for an refund and also a manager's email so that I could let them know about this incident. I was passed a card by the receptionist which after I walked out realised had no email on it at all. I called the numbers on the card and also no one picked up.

Really? Is this a coincidence or just an attempt to shut me up.

I used to take a massage in this shop and I loved this place. Because the quality of the massage and attitude of a staff was good in the average. But now they seem to expand the shop in another area such as bukitimah, which causes deterioration in the quality. The staff gave poor massage and chating with her collegue for the full time. I want her concentrated in the massage. I will not go there any more.
