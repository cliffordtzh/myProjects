Paid for two hours service but was told its done in 1 hr 45 min.

Went for a shower and before I can wear my clothes properly, the masseurs came in and wait to tidy up the room. I felt that Im chased out.

I was a regular here due to the number of masseurs here, especially the Malays they would have but everything just got worse. Staff counter dont bother answering the phone. Called 13x and I had to go down cause no one was answering. Next visit I went, I took Apple to massage me. During massaging, she made me release and expected me to pay her. I did not even ask for it and your staff has the cheeks to ask me for money? Is this how you staff should be?

The traditional deco of this place impressed me and I felt totally relaxed whenever I visit this place. Staffs (from boss, to receptionist to therapists) are very friendly. Strongly recommended for those who really enjoy a relax environment especially after a day of hard work.

Courteous receptionist gets one star.

Massuesse (Yuki) starts off soft strokes with more talking than massaging, seems unable to do both properly at the same time.

Chose questionable positions while fishing for info. Constantly pushed more expensive package massage. After turning that down, attitude changed and then average massages dropped to a fail and made it to the top of my DO NOT GO list.

(Translated by Google) 144 in 90 minutes. The massage is also pleasant. Amy (Emi) was friendly.
With pocket money 50.
After that, scrub your whole body with sand.
It was the best but the store I wanted to come back if the price was cheaper.
