Came here with my partner he seems to enjoy his hot and cold jacuzzi he told me for the gent side is way much bigger, for ladies they only have hot jacuzzi and  is slightly smaller than I expected. I very much enjoy my 60mins massage for the entire experience.
*Do take note For FEMALE*that come here u don need to bring ur swimsuit they will provide disposable kind of inner wear, shampoo & conditioner is also provided. Theres two dressing table for u to put ur make up on and a hairdryer to dry ur hair after shower, dont forget to bring makeup remover if u have make up on, while I was putting my makeup on theres few of the girls forgot to bring their makeup remover , other than that they are well taken care of the female side.
For the cafe wise food was ok don expect too much cause is a buffet kind eat all u want ,do try their chicken rice and curry with bread. Theres one guy in black I think is the manager at the cafe very much helpful and good customer, however theres this young guy and aunty in grey very rude. Is just few table there they like cannot handle the crowd. Imagine people come here enjoy then get turn off by their attitude but thankfully the one that managed the cafe is nice. Price for 2pax was $140++ is very reasonable.

Came here multiple times for years. Crowd control is needed as the spa has been really full ever since the start of covid19, even on weekdays. And with the distancing, you most likely need to wait for a seat at the sofa, spa and dining area.

The place where I dreamed long to go and is affordable! Their staff are very friendly and provide wonderful service. The food is above good with variety to choose from.

I stayed for 19 hours. Checked in at evening till next day lunch.
It would be even better if the temperature of their hot and cold pool be more friendly : )

All in all, they made you felt like you are a VIP there!

I shall visit there again

Came for the 1 for 1 promo which included a 90min massage + 24 hours access to facilities.

Overall pleasant experience, massage was good and solid though room was not exactly sound proof. Masseur technique was good and definitely professional, no chit chatting etc.

Male had more facilities vs womens, with a sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and cold bath.

Visited on a Saturday and place was not so packed with proper crowd control, thus better to call / book before heading down.

Food was free flow with a somewhat limited menu, had couple of misses but nothing that was too terrible to be consumed, overall no complains for a day trip out.

Better suited for double dates or groups as facilities are split by gender. All in all, still recommended and feel free to stay 24 hours given they have a sleeping area!

Despite being a g.spa regular and have been returning frequently today is my worse experience in g.spa. The cafeteria is a buffet concept but doesn't allow us to order more chicken wings. All the staffs just simply brush us off by saying that the chef said that the chicken wings is part of the nasi lemak set. However I was here last week when they had the chicken rice set but they allowed us to order more Chicken on the set when we wanted more. I just do not understand why we can't order more chicken wings. It's not a expensive item.

It was my first time at Gspa and i would say that i had a really great experience!

I got the Super Spa Experience package which was relatively affordable with a 60min full body massage, 40min foot massage and a 24h admission to all facilities at the spa for $163.

The facilities although abit old, is well maintained. The dining room with dishes from mains to small sides with hot or cold beverages. A sofa lounge where you can recline and relax and of course the jacuzzi and sauna!

Items that you would need are stocked up, towels, disposable underwears, disposable combs, rubber bands, cotton buds are provided. Shampoo, body wash, conditioner as well as body lotion too.

The staff members were also really attentive and nice! Making sure that my partner and i were comfortable and had everything that we needed.

My takeaway from this would be to bring someone of the same gender with you to enjoy facilities together as most of the time aside from the general areas are segregated, which is a little lonely when you have no one to talk to in the jaccuzi haha.

Would definitely recommend to friends and come back again!

This was our first time at the g.spa. As a very first feeling, the facilities looked a bit outdated and old which could give maybe wrongly some unclean appearances.

As first time visitors, something we mentioned at the reception, we have not really been given any guidance or explanations on the spa rules. The changing clothes and shoes were at the end not fitting us (for example this was hard to climb the stairs to go to the couple room)

We had also booked a 1hour couple room with jacuzzi. Again, no one to really guide us at the end. Most importantly, there was no shower in this couple room. So not really convenient to remove all the foam and soap accumulated from the jacuzzi.

In addition, the staff indicated that the pictures with the decorations with mermaids for example are only on the men side. So ladies, dont expect your side to be as the one as you can see on the pictures.

At the end we were a bit disappointed and stayed only approximately 2hours knowing this is a 24hours spa.

My husband paid for the 1 for 1 package in Nov and we just came at end of Feb to utilize it. The external of the building of Gspa is really old and run down. Overall feel of the area when you first step in is that it is really dim and need a refresh in their Reno. After a late lunch (with changing hot dishes menu everyday), we went off to our respective male and female hot bath area. The auntie there is friendly and show a newbie like me around. The hot bath area for females is on the 3rd floor (up a flight of stairs). It is really small and on a weekday afternoon it was not luckily not crowded and I get to use it after waiting for two groups to leave the hot bath. After 1hour plus, we assembled at dining area for our massage slots and off we go. The massage auntie is good and I enjoyed it. After 90 mins I went back to the dining area for dinner. Overall I dont think I can spend more than 6 hours there including the meals and massages even though we can spend up to 24 hours there. Facilities are quite small, food can be boring after two meals there and we cant rest with much privacy. Massages are quite good so thats their saving grace.

I believe this might not be a good fit for people who prefer a quiet spa experience. Lots of water splashing by 2 different groups of people while I was there. Watching their shows on the phone or just talking very loudly in general with disregard of others.

Though I arrived at ard 1030pm and recognise spa pools are only cleaned at 3-4am, the water had a distinct smell which lingers on top of the usual scent of chlorine. I would not recommend this place if you're interested in a pleasant and relaxing spa experience.

The relaxation lounge is much better though, with comfortable and dim settings. The food choice at night was mainly toasts, dim sums, and soup of the day with drinks. The custard bao was delicious according to my friend.  Perhaps the lunch/dinner menu is much more enticing, though I did not stay here long enough to try it out.

No booking needed, just walked in. We came one sunday noon and leave next monday. Aunty in female fitting room very friendly and nice, always check with us and guide us to enjoy the steam room. Not crowded, maybe next day is working day. Sauna room too small and only occupied by one person, other ppl might need to queue for it. Food taste is not bad especially traditional kaya toast which make me homesick. Many rest chair TV have no signal and cannot fix, lucky got free wifi to watch own movie online. Midnight wil have someone walking around and pls expect can't sleep well. *Many uncles here*

Went on a Sunday afternoon and there was quite a number of patrons, but I wouldn't say it was crowded. The place was beautiful, and the food (buffet style) was surprisingly good, both in terms of quality and variety. One gripe would be that I found the water way too hot.

I only come here for the good massage by the masseuse here (which is what the 5 star is for) and reasonably good food it serves (limited selection due to heightened alert currently), the sauna room and hot steam room. Thats all.

Personally I dont use the shared mens pool due to confidence in hygiene matters, doing hygiene matters when the pool is only meant for soaking and dipping to relax. People talking loudly, or on their phone, or watching some videos with very loud music/ talking etc. I feel hygiene and spa rules can be further improved / regulated to make this place more appealing to the younger crowds. But I guess it has more or less been cultivated so it may offend old timers in the process.

Still, I personally appreciate this concept of a spa + massage + resting + dining all in one, is quite nice actually, just that I guess over the years the regulars who come here are a typical group which may not fit well with the Gen Z and Gen Y group.

With the above said, the masseuses here are the better ones in Singapore. I hope it remains good like that and I will continue to visit.

The service staff here are also very tolerant and friendly and service-oriented group of people. For example, the receptionists, the Cafeteria lady who ensured I had my fill of food and drinks, and also not to forget the management who approved my expired credit (due to lock-down) to be utilized. Considering the overall experience, this place still deserves a 5 star for being one of its kind in Singapore.

Whole spa centre consist mainly of individual treatment rooms (mostly not occupied?), common facilities like resting area is quite limited and small, always occupied by snoring and chatty middle aged man. Steam room, jacuzzi also small, not able to stay longer. Food is mediocre.

Great IF there is more different kinds of hot & cold pools and overall bigger space for common facility area.

1 star for the reception.
I have no idea how to rate for this.
I first time came here,thinking to have a relaxing long weekend,and gspa is what we choose.
Once we entered here,we showed the booking QR code to the receptionist that we made online,and the receptionist named Ada Zhang told us that we didn't make reservation for massage. But there is no time available for us to book in the website. My bf said he called few times but no one answering the calls,she insist they  have answer calls. What a funny thing is the customer checking in next to us interrupted "I also called for many times,but no one answer my call." Attitude please be good,you're not only ruined the customers' mood, also the reputation of the company. We doesn't mean to blame anyone,but please behave yourself as a receptionist,the way she reply us is fxcking RUDE.
By the way,the services of all area are wonderful only except the reception.

its a very relaxing and enjoyable weekend getaway spot. The food is really above my expectation for free flow ala carte buffet menu, all the food are served hot and tasty. the resting lounge is surprisingly available for us 3 pax even on a weekend as i saw alot of reviews of overcrowding but it was a pleasant experience for my case. i was very lucky at some point time i was even able to have the whole jacuzzi hotpool and steam and sauna to myself so i manage to snap some photos or else you must get permission from other users if you want to take photos or video. for ladies spa facilities it has a jacuzzi hot pool (can fit 4 pax), steam room (maybe can fit 4 pax too) and a sauna room (strictly 1 pax or if you go with a friend and both are very slender maybe can fit 2). all the spa facilities is very relaxing I love it and I can use it 3 times in a visit and head down to the cafe for another meal again as you gets hungry easily after all the sweat from sauna and steam and jacuzzi hot pool. my husband described for me the man's spa facilities and it sounded like their's is way much nicer and cooler than the ladies'. it itches my heart to want to visit the male section too (just kidding) i got a massage of gateway to vitality too for 60mins and its like an acupoint massage similar to tuina and you can request for softer or stronger massage. please make an appointment in advance especially for massage as weekend they are quite fast filled.you really feel resfreshed after the massage but some spots are achy after the acupoint massage as the masseur mentioned my certain muscles is very stiff. i could say you totally do not need to bring anyting except your ID , phone cable charger, sleeping eyemask, and your money for payment as this spa literally provides everything from disposable underwear, disposable bra, short pant and robe for when relaxing at the resting lounge. shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, hair band, shower cap, towels, hair dryer, comb, cotton bud, free flow drinks and foods and even blankets to use at resting lounge. i have worried for nothing as its my first time visiting a spa and i brought everything i could think of that i may needed and ended up just keeping it in the locker.

This place used to be good when we started coming 3years back but the standard has dropped a lot since then. We use to enjoy good food, massage and a comfortable environment!

Now the food standard is poor. The kaya toast no longer taste good. The menu is mostly carbs and sometimes the fries are stale.

The massage varies. If we get someone who is good, its good but u need to request for it otherwise u will get someone who is unskilled or someone who massage for the sake of massaging.

The chairs use to be comfortable but it has been 3 years since we came and they didn't change the chair hence the leather has torn and cracked so now they used a towel to cover it instead.

We wanted to try the place for the first time as recommended by a friend so called around 11 pm to ask what time is next available slot and they said 12:15 am on the phone multiple times but when my bf arrived they said they confirmed 1:15 am so he cannot be accommodated. I hope they were just honest that they made a mistake but they insisted they confirmed 1:15. Very Poor customer service and disrespectful of time. If they cannot handle simple scheduling I suppose experience would have not been great either plus place looks shady and tacky.

Visited the spa on 27 Sep (Sunday). Bought the 1 for 1 promotion, I think the price for it was worthy. With 24 hours amenities and cafe (you can order from their ala cart menu from 12pm to 1030pm), the rest of the time I think their steamer got bao; bun available.

The place was cozy, but feeling not so good due to the resting sofa was quite packed and end up we got no place to rest.. but we do ask a staff to assist us in finding two resting sofa for us.. so in general I think it was a little packed.. especially resting sofa,  and cafe during meal time.

Hope to see improvement.

Overall still a Super good experience and a place to relax.

I had booked this place for a couples massage for me and my wife. I had selected a particular massage at the time of booking. We were looking for a relaxing massage as opposed to a deep tissue massage. When we reached, we were told that the massage that we had booked ( g. Business class) was only a deep tissue massage. The website did not provide this information. It shouldve been a simple task of asking the therapist to change the massage. But they didnt budge and were quite inflexible. Additionally, the place appeared super-commercial. A bad experience overal!

Decided to try out G.spa because of the 1 for 1 promo. Massage was great and the free food was surprisingly good. Also spent some time resting on their armchair there and it was really relaxing. The aunty there was also very helpful and showed us around the place when we were a little lost. Only thing some pple might feel uncomfortable about is that most of the areas are shared among both genders. You will be wrapped with nothing but a robe and some disposable bra and panty underneath. Other than that, the rest was a pleasant experience. The shower, soap and shampoo provided were also really nice smelling. Will definitely visit again if there is another promo.

Recent experience is getting good to worst, food order have been forgotten a couple of time and have to repeat asking if the food going to be serve, last time can press a button to call waiters, now don't have button. Hard to get them to come over. Massage is also getting worst none of the massager make me feel satisfied but more scare as they just give you more pain. I will finish the rest of my package and not come again. As there is better alternative.

i don't know why these spa operators are brainless, why don't they just build the jacuzzi/spa tub inside the private couple room and let them have own privacy to enjoy it?? I believe if they do like that it will attract a lot of couples like to come.

Been member of Gspa since 2019 and top up my package a few times. For this recent visit the massgae wise is okay. But the restaurant service is terrible and disappointed me. I order two chef's recommendation at around 3.40pm on 1st August. At around 4pm i saw there is two chef recommendation(chicken chop) coming out from the kitchen and the waiter served to other tables which came later than us. So i went to ask the waiter where is our food as it is been 20mins and we get reply is that the chicken chop is finished and ask us to get other food. Which meant she serve the last chef recommendation (chicken chop) which to be served to us and give to other table order much later then us. It was a terrible experience and becoz of this, i wont top up my package anymore. Faster use up all my credit and wont ever visit Gspa again. Absolutely bad service experience.

Lousy place for relaxation. Feeling cheated by the review from blogger! Overrated and overpriced! The entire place is running down, I guess no proper maintenance. The atmosphere at here is like entering KTV lounge/China club! Nothing fantastic about the food.

It is nice place to spend time with excellent Chinese massage & small dishes which is free for 24 hours. Hands of massagier is top level im Singapore. But price is 155 for 1 hour, 188 for 90 min, 220 for 2 hours. Recommendable place to visit

Call up and booked a 60 mins gateway to vitality massage on 8 Feb and pay as a non member price of $155 (including use of spa facilities). Requested for a male therapist cos I want a strong massage. He was indeed strong but I didn't experience the kind of "tension relief" or "Shiok" reactions commonly associated with good massages. I think it has something to do with his skills and motion rhythm  connection. All in all I didn't feel better and at some instances it was kinda painful even. So it wasn't satisfactory to say the least. Not sure whether the receptionist kinda expected I won't be satisfied with the massage as they didn't even try to sell me a package. Promptly  gave me the bill for the massage,

I won't mind going back to chill out at the spa facilities but realised I won't be able to utilise a Promo voucher which allows access the facilities for 24 hours at $53.50 as I'm not considered 1st customers now isn't it?

One star taken away only because I know of a place in Singapore that has a better jacuzzi.

Otherwise this is a very legit alternative to going for a staycation for 2. You can nap on the sofa, eat all the food, drink all the drinks. And pick from a variety of massages to suit your mood.

For men, enjoy a hot soak and jacuzzi with your buddies. Then challenge each other to see who can last longer in the cold dip. Only the brave have stepped one foot, then the other into the cold pool.

Not many have lived to tell the tale.

Actually during my visit there, I did see someone dip fully in. And I remember thinking to myself, what is the guy made of?

Service is good, no hard sell to get you to buy a prepaid arrangement so you can enjoy member rates.

Just enquired if I had visited within the last 12mths to be eligible for the qoo10 promotion at 53.50. Was greeted and served very nastily as though why am I even checking this. Staff does not know how to check records and hung up upon discovering my visit was in jan and it is 1mth away from the 12mth window.

I love this place! Great spa.. for men and women the proffesional masseurs have deep knowledge of the human body and they do exactly what is needed so as t makw us feel relaxed and painless after 1h massage!
Also there is a rest area where you can have a quick bite, coffee,  tea or juices!
The prices are realistic not too expensive, considering always what they offer.

really good place to chill out if you want some ME time. I chilled at the Lougne for some coffee and dim sum after which went for a nice relaxing massage and soak myself in the jacuzzi. Didnt feel like going home after cause its way too tranquil and relaxing hence went for a foot massage afterwhich and its dinner time! Dinner was surprisingly pretty good given the fact its FREE. 5 stars

In SG this probably a better place to go to spend a quiet day. They offer reasonable good message and foot spa.
Full spa facilities available.
All meals and drink are provided though the quality of food now are not as good as before.
There are Wifi available in the main dinning and resting area where u could also do yr work if need to.
TV entertainment are available in rest area.

Sauna-game is quite strong. Dry sauna has a water dispense button that you can press every 5th min to push up the humidity. Steam is very hot and smelled fresh of mint. Cold plunge is veeery cold compared to most places. Couldnt even stay for a minute. Bonus for small ice towels / ice bath making hot/cold routine very efficient and fun.

Where it lacks for me is the decor, and the food is... OK. Also can be a bit noisy, ideal to come in group or with friends and perhaps not alone for peace. For that I recommend Yunomori which is nearby.

Nice place for relax and destress. Hot pool and sauna avaulable for both the male and female section. Nice cafe where they serve a variety of dishes ranging from western cuisines to local food such as Nasi Lemak or Hokien Mee etc. Facia service available. Massuers are very well trained and experience and make you feel very relax after the massage. Food reflexlogy is also available.

Environment is ok but the massage is more than horrible!! Asking a foot massage massuer to do body aroma massage for you... The techniques are uncomfortable and not not worth for the price at all. Greatly disappointed

Forgotten to mention the massuer was also rude and unfriendly. I dont know what I am paying for... Upset and waste of time and spoilt my mood indeed

Make your money worth by setting aside at least 3 to 4 hours to spend at the spa. Have some snacks, order a meal and have a drink, do these while waiting for your service. Enjoy a dip in the jacuzzi, go for a sauna or steam bath and destress before or after. There are also alot of food options around the area so it is really convenient.

Very nice place to get a good relaxing time.. compared to e.g wensha spa in Manila this place rocks!
The hot water is really hotand the cold water tub is extremely cold .. im a Vinking and used to swim  in iced covered water...in Copenhagen and I still got surprised over how cold it was!

Great deal! 68 SD including food and drink for a
24 hour stay... why book a hotel???

Wonderful place, i liked the semi lit and quiet ambience. The food was buffet style with quite a wide selection. Stayed late so there was teochew porridge on top of their normal food but i think it is only avaliable on fridays and saturdays late night. Good place to chill and perhaps pamper yourself, can also bring a partner along if you like cos i think they have couple rooms for massage but didnt try that.
