Managed to book a last min slot at this place. Good quality and authentic Thai massage. Similar to what you will get if you are in Thailand. Price is also reasonable. I was a bit worried at first since this is my first time trying but I really liked the massage.

Uncle at counter was also polite to clients.

This is not authentic Thai massage. The women aren't trained. I asked for extra hard thai massage and was terribly let down. I wanted to walk out after 5 mins into the massage but was told that another massuse who could massage hard and well would be available in about 30mins. I waited as I had already prepaid. It was the most hyped up massage that left me disappointed and totally unrelieved. I felt more stiff after than I did walking in there. I asked for more pressure but received less pressure. I also asked for shoulders and traps but got my arms massaged instead. I asked for glutes and hamstrings but got my calves massaged instead. I then got told I should stretch everyday and that I worked on a keyboard that's why I have tight traps. Both comments were not relevant as I do stretch everyday and I dont use a keyboard ever. Its like the massuse was making it up as she went along. She was saying how she has massaged for over 20years but she was atrociously inaccurate in her diagnosis and inaccurate with her massage. Both massuses were terrible. I wasted $55 and 90mins of my life there.
In conclusion, this place is good for people who don't know what thai massage is and who want untrained women hitting your spine with their elbow and not knowing anything about the human body. How this place has over a 4 star rating is beyond me.

EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF. DO NOT GO.

First time going. Booked a session for my mum and me at 1050pm for 90mins. Told the lady I am looking forward to the massage as I heard good review- I am coming all the way from Tampines.

Arrived around 1030pm and sat at coffeeshop to drink water and got a call- hello can shift to 1120pm? I said I was already outside 1120 quite late what happened? Plus I booked for 90mins! Got no bus later. Mentioned that a customer came late. I said, oh dear should have told them to shorten as you have other customer- or inform me earlier. ( i don't think this is an unfair request- massage is  at least 1hour long- u inform me only 20mins before for a 30min++ delay??)

Man started to yell me at me 'BOOKING IS A PREVILEGE! WE  NEVER EVEN TAKE MONEY FOR YOUR BOOKING! AT LEAST WE COURTESY CALL YOU!'

To which i hung up because no one should listen to such rudeness. Standards so low- apparently we must be happy they never ask money for booking and be grateful that they give a call when they the ones that screw up.

There are many other places in this times of covid that need business- this place apparently business too good so staff can afford to be so rude to customer! MUST AVOID. Not worth the time.

I was here due to the good reviews, but was terribly disappointed. My masseuse was inexperienced although she had a pretty good attitude, but the experience was unpleasant and non thai-like, where pressure applied on bones and wrists? light squeezes on arms, thighs and unusually long rubs on neck. Did not alleviate muscle soreness.

I did overhear the next door customer complimenting the other masseuse, so I think experience varies with who you are allocated.

Amendment: there was a mistake in my pricing comment, so I have redacted it.

For me its the best thai message I've ever experienced. At first I was skeptical as rarely do massage parlours have their massages on the floor. However, after going through the massage I think all massage parlours should do their massages on the floor. Only then can the massage be done with full effort and those hard to reach places like inner thighs can be stretched. I fully recommend this place.

Strong authentic Thai massage, with the masseuse constantly asking you if the pressure is good enough. Indeed the pressure was good! For those who are wondering I'm 6ft tall and generally people who try to crack my back often lose balance and fall down, this lady steady can crack my back without losing balance. Not for the weak minded looking for a gentle backrub.

Edit: reduced to 3 stars due to an unpleasant visit on 23/12/20 after being a regular here for 3 years.

A new hire was assigned who was inexperienced and had a big room for improvement. Better QC should have been in place to Ensure competency of masseuse.

It was so bad I had to stop the massage halfway approx 25 mins left. Shop offered refund $7 for my 25/60 mins ($55) massage left which left me confused. Rejected the refund and left an unhappy customer.

Previous review:

Excellent authentic massage service in the heartlands. May wish to call for an appointment before heading down. Wendy is an excellent masseuse, never fails to knead those aches away. Price is reasonable and facilities are clean and comfortable.

Had at 90 mins body massage yesterday that was just dreadful. The masseuse was inexperienced and not using any kind of massage technic. All she was doing was pressing her hands and elbows into my skin repeatedly with her full body weight, this is not massage!. I came here because of the high reviews but the reviews do not match with the massage i received yesterday.

It was my first time over here and I had an amazing experience. The owner of this place is polite and answers your queries honestly. The interior of this establishment is clean and cozy. Therapists are experienced and know exactly what they are doing. Do not be afraid of Therapists using too much/little strength. There was clear communication between therapist and customer as well. Good location I must say for east siders! I will definitely recommend anyone, from having a relaxing massage, or to the fitness enthusiasts. This is the place to be

Yesterday was my last visiting this shop. The massager was not professional and doesn't know how to massage well. Even she spent over 20min for only one spot of my temple. Moreover she has finished 10min earlier of my 2hr massage. No worth anymore.

I had just arrived following a long journey from Europe . Before I left I found TD Spa in a google search and booked a 90 minute massage . it was well worth it . A superb masseur who clearly knew what she was doing . it was an excellent and very professional deep tissue massage . Well worth the very reasonable promotional price of  $68 .
The only down side was the fact that conditions were a bit cramped for the masseur , which was less than ideal  Absent that one criticism I would have given them 5 stars

The first time i came here, i had a great experience as they assigned a thai therapist to me. This time i came again, and they assigned a Chinese therapist who claimed she knew thai massage. For those who understand thai massage, its nothing like your swedish or aromatherapy massage with effleurages. She was trying to complete the one hour massage with just light touches and oil massage throughout. She used zero thai massage techniques and the pressure was completely soft and hard, and she could not tell the difference between bones and muscles. She had hands of a sandpaper. Just imagine being tortured throughout. I could tell she probably never graduated from a Thai massage school at all.

I went there on my second last day in Singapore, pretty impressed. I had my shoulder strained and after this Thai massage it went away immediately. Relaxed. Just few tips: Remember to mention how much pressure we want, else you may feel pain. Only cons here is, masseuse keep talking with each other. Bit noisy...

Lack of Business ethics.  My appointment for Husband and I was for an hour massage at 3.30pm. But when we texted to inform we would be 10 mins late due to traffic, we were informed to go at 4 pm because they gave allowed a customer to extend for 1/2 hour to 4 pm.  How could they do this when they have accepted advance appointments? Ridiculous!
