Today 3rd time visiting, and registered the membership. The masseuse Apple is very friendly and her massage is just perfect for me. I hope she stay here for long that i can visit every week. She is the only reason i visit this massage shop.

Have my massage today by Apple, my wife is a regular customer here, sometimes she got masseurs that the massage style to her liking. But she always forgot to ask their names. Since this few days my whole body, especially my shoulder ache due to moving house. Love this spa, since it is near our house, read the recommended review, found Apple. Luckily managed to get her. True enough, she is very professional, skillful and tried to massage my worst ache area. So far, i felt much better. Thanks Apple. Highly recommend. Keep up the good works.

Ayesha is a very skillful and knowledgeable massuer. She has almost 20 years of experience! No wonder! I have gone to several sports massage from other outlets, i can tell that she definitely knows how to identify muscle knots and how to loosen those tight muscles. Will definitely come back!

Today, I go for a massage at Absolute Massage. Apple, a massage therapist, did me a good job. My shoulder was uncomfortable at first, but there was no problem after I finished it

I was unsatisfied with the first masseur, might be due to self preference. They then gimme a compliment session after I feedback. Surprised with the administration as they recognise every single customer. They changed a Vietnamese masseur for me. I can only say this masseur is one of the best I ever met. Concern , hard enough on the right spot. Feel relived right after the session. I would like to request her again next time !

Massages here are very good, HOWEVER the gentleman sitting at the front desk (Stanley), working on the computer is totally "LOST". There was no greeting, no eye contact and he seemed SO lost when we arrived for my massage. He cannot find my appointment, the desk is in a mess n he was flipping here n there while we stood and waited there.

He DID NOT WEAR ANY MASK at all when we got there. And when one of the customers bought food for everyone, he was munching away, talking on the phone and talking with another masseur who wore a mask). Please educate and ensure your front receptionist has some manners and good hygiene.

Apple is really skillful. Shes very observant and sensitive to my needs. She knew my left shoulder was aching just by observing me taking off my bag. Usually I dont have to tell her anything and she already knows what I need. My shoulder felt so much better after the massage. Thank you, Apple!

For the past one year, i have visited the same place, Abosulte massage and all the time was attended by Apple.
She is the therapist that i would prefer here.

Have been visiting this place whenever my body is aching/sore. After each visit, it felt so much better. The staffs are friendly & a relaxing environment. After multiple visits, I would highly recommend to look for Apple, the masseur. No doubt, each time she know how to 'fix' my body aches. Have never try the other masseur, but since I had her to massage for my first visit & have been requesting for her. Enjoy!

First time visiting here since I dont live in the East. I was quite skeptical initially due to the few bad reviews posted. But I was amazed that the massage service was a lot better then expected. Maybe different people has different preference, but the massage here suits me just right.

Good place for a nice massage if you guys live near Downtown east. Decent place with good cleanliness. Masseur Apple is great. Enough strength and knowledgeable enough to identify where my body needs more attention.
I thought 40 minutes would be sufficient but i go at least do a 60. Will be trying a combo next time.

I booked 2 slots for 8.45pm and arrived on time yet they turned us down saying they called and I didn't answer (I called them twice and their line was engaged!) so they gave the slot to other people. It is clearly written in their msg they will hold the slot for 15mins and yet they do this! Really disappointed with their booking personnels

I am writing in the midst of the foot massage session. Inconsistent strength. Random strokes. Masseur was not really sure she was doing. Base of feet gets 5 mins of random strokes. Her focus was more on the calf than feet.  She even sat on the foot rest (next to my feet to massage my calf). Copied moves from her colleague next to her. Not sure what kind of foot massage I am receiving. In my opinion, it is a pure waste of my time and money. Very unlikely to return again.

Reconsider going.. Absolutely the worst massage place Ive ever been to! The massage was terrible, then when requesting that they do something about it the comments were sarcastic and dismissive.

We tried absolute massage for the first time in early December and was very impressed and booked another appointment in late December.

The second session was an utter disappointment. Both our masseuses during our return visit had extremely poor techniques and executed the massage very hurriedly. The massage did nothing to relieve our sores. The standards of both massages were vastly different and it's surprising how the masseuse all working in the same parlour can have such different standards.

Thought this could be our go to massage place but will never return here again. Not worth the money at all. Extremely disappointing and a waste of time.

Look for therapist Apple. I had a stiff lower back and aching joints when I first visited, and was so impressed by her skills as she loosened all of my knots. Her skills are consistent and service is good. I highly recommend her as she is very sensitive and can identify problem areas immediately. Apple is good :)

I never had a foot and back massage as bad as this. The worst experience. The masseuse kept giggling with her colleague through the session, no reflexology technique..shes the dark skinned, thai or Filipino short bob hair lady. Dipped my foot into tub and ask me to take out my foot without scrubbing and put my leg up. Oh gosh i was begging for the session to finish even before it starts. Worst experience $55 session ever!

One of the worst massage experience I had. Made a reservation for 40mins body massage at 12pm. Arrived on the dot, but the receptionist seemed to be caught offguard and unaware of my appointment. Did not bother checking their system either, so I just told her what I was there for and was ushered in.

Massage start: the first stroke (upwards on my right back muscle), and her hands slipped and poked the back of my ear. I knew it was going to be a bad session.
In summary it was just a hasty, uncomfortable massage session. The strength was random, there seemed to be some pattern, yet erratic at times. Overall it just felt really unskilled.

The entire experience felt like she was really distracted and couldnt wait for the clock to strike 40mins and leave (the irony that I felt the same way too). If you are looking for a definition of going through motion, this is it. Nearing the end of the session (maybe arnd 10mins to go), she seemed to be just finding things to while the time away - I think she spent a good 5mins playing piano on my neck/shoulder area, at times pausing for too long as though she was using her phone or dozing off.

At the end of my session, was led out by another receptionist. No offer of water (by this point I didnt expect it anymore). I promptly paid and left.

No relief of tightness and in fact I felt more soreness (NOT the shiok after massage kind of pain).

Lady Masseur is inexperience in terms of foot massage. Basically brushing and stroking so softly and never on the point! I never once had such a bad experience in foot reflexology! Will not recommend to this place. Wasted time n money! Oh, I did not know 10 mins of soaking feet is counted into the 60mins massage! Basically 50mins massage and 10 mins of soaking feet. :(

This is my second visit tonight. Love the massage here and I'm glad
they have managed to solve the aircon issue with the mall's management.
(It used to be making a lot of noises, but since it's centralised they
couldn't do much about it). Continue the good work!

Went for a massage for me and my husband after Circuit breaker period was over as both of us in need of a really good massage. Booked a 90mins full body massage for a total of $160 at the downtown east branch. Our first ever experience here. Me and my husband was 10mins late, they called us asking where we were and will wait for our arrival. Thank god they did not cancel our booking. The place look pleasant, clean and nice. Was escorted into a couple room and was left in the room without explaining on what to do next but that we dont mind. The thing is, we can hardly relax due to the noise of the air-condition or the air vent. Im not sure where the noise came from. It was sure not a pleasant thing to hear when you want to feel at peace during your pampering time. The massage too was so so. They really go hard on, focusing more on my upper body but hardly on my leg... For the whole entire 90mins of the massage, i can say 4/5 of the time were spent massaging my upper body... and sadly the 1/5 of time that were spent massaging my legs, nil effort was put in. I felt no pressure and they simply just massaging the oil onto my skin.. i felt that my money & time spent was totally not worth it. There are other places that ive been to that provide better services.

I booked 2 appointments 8.30pm and 9.30pm under 2 different names with 2 different types of services required via online. At 6.15pm, I called to cancel the 8.30pm, mentioning the name, type of service (Body Massage) and time of booking (8.30pm). When I came at 9pm (for my 9.30pm appointment), received by the Manager, I was told it was cancelled as well. I was told my slot was taken and to come another day. Yes, I was chased away that easy without apologising. The Manager said that when I cancelled 8.30pm appointment, means I cancelled 9.30pm too.. that's what she thought.The way the Manager handle the situation was bad.

Did a 2 hour massage for my sore muscles at the Downtown East branch yesterday. Seriously did not understand what was going on as the massage felt very pointless. There was no proper technique. Wasted $100 and woke up today feeling the same soreness as before the massage.

(Translated by Google) Very good, I like it very much, every physiotherapist is very polite and has a good attitude. Today is the physiotherapist Ha who helped me. After the end, I feel a lot more relaxed. I signed up for a membership today and can enjoy the membership price. Come on, it's really comfortable.
