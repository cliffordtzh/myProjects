I went at noon on a Monday  they took me in immediately and the service was so warm and friendly! As the shop name suggests, everyone here is hard of sight. The shop interior is dim/dark. The massage was FANTASTIC. Got myself a 45min foot and 45min shoulder massage for a cool $50. Definitely coming back here again.

Really good place to get a massage! Especially after sitting at the desk all day. The prices are unbeatable, the therapists are skilful and the place is neat and tidy. The best thing is that you will be supporting dignified work for persons with visual disabilities. 

Update: My shoulder ache disappeared the next day! So impressed Im gonna go back every week!

First time visit. Did a 1 hour foot and 1 hour shoulder/back. The massages were fantastic, even better than some of the top massage places in SG. The therapists hit the right spots and helped to relieve the tension in problematic areas. Thank you! Will definitely come back again.

Really enjoy my visits. Ive been visiting this establishment regularly. The price is exceptional for the level of quality I get. I have chronic pain in my leg due to an injury in the past and I am quite physically active. The masseuse are visually impaired, but their heighten sense of touch allows them to know where exactly on your body requires more attention. Really excellent place to get a no to thrift massage.

I would say I had the best massage I have ever gotten here! Its different from your regular spa massage since amenities are basic but the skills of the masseuse is top notch, they can target all the right and sore spots with precision with the right amount of force. And price is soooo reasonable compared to all other massage places. HIGHLY RECOMMEND COMING HERE FOR MASSAGE

Went for a 60 minute head shoulders and neck massage in the evening with my girlfriend. I made an appointment the previous day through SMS with the phone number listed on their Facebook page and glad I did because the place was packed; for a good reason

The services rendered are professional, no frills and to the point. Once we got started, I let the masseuse (Richard) know about pains/tightness I was experiencing and he began pressing away, all whilst asking if the massage was ok. Funny question by him because it was a great massage, felt A LOT of relief in my back and shoulders immediately after.

Will be returning here regularly and trying out the full body and foot massages!! Im sure I wont be disappointed :)

Fuss-free but excellent- there probably isn't anywhere else providing comparable service at such prices and location. They don't use oils, so you can even pop by before an appointment in town. I suggest calling ahead if you're going on a weekend (I go almost every other week), and ask for Desmond (my go-to). Enjoy!

Such relieve and baby sleep after the massage. Staff were also very understanding to keep volume minimal and not chit chatting during the massage. Best I've every tried from oil to deep tissue to lymphatic etc, this massage is the best and will definitely return and make this my regular spot.

Great service as usual and very friendly people. I don't usually post reviews but I just felt very bad when I heard about customers who made booking but did not turn up and did not pick up the phone when the masseur called to check if the customers are coming. As a result they lost income for that hour as they turned down a few walk-in enquiries as they reserved the slot for the customers who did not turn up in the end. Do call them to inform if there is any change to your plans and they will appreciate that. Richard was very patient to help with my sore neck and shoulder. Thank you!

Great massage by blind masseurs who want to use their skills for their own livelihood. Wee Sin, Pin Pin, Swee Tin, Desmond, and their team are trained to do foot reflexology and body massage. I find myself alternating between foot massage, shoulder and back massage, and full body massage (fully clothed). Text for a time slot and Wee Sin will reply quickly. Appointments are highly recommended as they can get busy.

The shoulder massage includes brief massages of the head and arms.

She has great customer service - asking where I would like to focus on, and even asking if I am wearing slippers/shoes to see if she needs to wipe down my feet. And for $55 for 90min - what value for money!!! Do support them!!

Chance upon this place while having food at tanjong pagar food center. Not your atypical massage place. The staffs are visually impaired. Why they special then? It is their non discriminating way of serving customer. In a typical place. Most other operators will judge you via your physical build and deploy unusual heavy strength and thus sometime resulted in bruising.
This place however is different, 3 of my attempts were greeted with masseuse who consistently ask about the area of concern and will consistently kneeling out the stuff muscle. Result: painless smooth out muscle.

Expect long queue and turn away for walking customer. please do call 1 day in advance for arrangement.
Also good note to ask for their name for future return.
They are generally nice chatter. Make their day great and they will make your greater.

I will write based on my experience since this is my first time going to their place :

1) You can request either male or female masseur.
2) Do make a call and book for appointment date and time first before heading down.
3) Affordable and a simple ambience.

Overalls, they did a professional job. I choose full body massage and reflexology foot massage. It's nice. Looking forward to come again one day.
