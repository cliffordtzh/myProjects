One of the better spa & wellness you can find in the west.

Majority will be disappointed if you are looking for something more or special

Good thing is they do not show any discrimination if you only go for the basic $50/hour package.

My massage lady did her best to ensure i am overall happy with the services. Indeed, I am.

Had a good massage here with Rachael.  she is friendly and nice and very sensitive massage, always checking in if the pressure is right or if im feeling any pain.  Her english is good, so communication is easy, and she is friendly and nice.  highly recommended

The ambient is good, a tranquil and relax feeling.  A Massage Therapist- Lily, which I have frequent quite a few times does have good massage skills. She will make you feel relax for the one or one and half session, depending on your request session period. You will definitely have a pleasurable experience with her massage therapist skills and before you know it, the session is up. Yup, definitely a good recommendation for her.

This is undoubtedly the worst massage I ever go for in my life, which I regretted patronizing. I was requesting for full body aroma oil massage. However, the masseuse insisted that that for the price I am paying for would merely be normal massage. The overall massage session was neither relaxing or a pleasant one for me. Before and after the massage just makes no difference at all, my bodyache still persists and it doesn't alleviate any of the associated pain. Most of the time, she tried to utilise her cold-calling strategies to make me do unnecessarily expensive treatment as to profiteer, which I don't give a budge. And moreover the service attitude was extremely bad and below my satisfaction.This is one of the most costly lesson for me for such a substandard and ineffective massage. Once before but never again and I going. Hope potential patrons do take note.

Hi guys, I was recommended to try out the service here. It didnt disappoint. I came in tired and came out refreshed. I was also recommended to try a masseur- Lily, which, she was the main reason, besides the smoothing ambient, that has refreshed me up. She is patient, know where to apply the right pressure, attractive and friendly. It was really a good experience compared to other places. I have become her regulator ever since visited her the first time few months ago. I am sharing this few months later because to see whether she maintain her consistency or not, and she didnt fail. A must try type. Enjoy your service guys

Call them and book for a masseuse.

If you dont book, youll get a not good masseuse.

Good masseuse: Ice, Star, Lavender.

Bad masseuse: Other than those 3.

Best would be Ice. 100/100.
Star 90/100
Lavender 80/100.
Others 50/100.

Book either those 3, or dont go at all.

massage there is no where close to even an average massage. In one hour session they will massage you only for 10-15 mins rest of the time they will spend going in /out of the room getting towels etc. Too noisy and for not even a single minute you will feel pampered. Try your luck and ask for h**** end.

This spa is no different from a regular spa outlet in Singapore ...the services are most average and the Therapists are not really friendly . at the end of massage you won't feel Soo good, but just ok.$50/hr is a very common Price tag every where in Singapore and you may find a better ambience and spa service some where else .

Very worst spa.Not given use and throw clothes.Given washable cloths to wear which one is very dirty.In locanto and some other places they are posting some beautiful girl pics pls don't get deceived by those.Very average girls are there.Asked 38$ additional for HJ.I strictly said no.After massage you never feel satisfactory.50$ are too high for their service.And finally no one can understand English.

You fall asleep after a good massage therapist will walk away for a good 10 to 15 mins. How I know? Of course woke up and found it. I never call the therapist as I want to see how long she come back. Talk to the counter about it and the fat lady say that not true. Stupid fat lady
