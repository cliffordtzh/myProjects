Unpleasant encounter at Precious Foot Clementi outlet because of the rude staff counter (I think she is the manager). I asked for 30 min foot massage and 20 min neck and shoulder massage. My masseuse was Ivy, she served me with a herbal foot bath (10min) and told me that I can switch on the tap to add more hot water if needed. After awhile, the water temperature was cooling off and I turned on the tap to add a little more water. The staff counter immediately hollered to Ivy that 'the customer is switching on the tap on her own'. I felt embarrassed by the unprofessional behaviour of the staff counter. I was clearly told by Ivy that I can add more water if I want to. Masseuse Ivy was kind and tried to make up for the unpleasantness. I will give Ivy 5 stars for her massage skills and 1 star for the staff counter.

Convenient location at Toa Payoh. No Hard sell! Great services by both the receptionist Nicole (hope I got the name right) and Jackson!
Nicole is very patient and took time to listen to my worries.
Jackson on the other hand is very skilful! I STRONGLY recommend him! From the massage, you can see the years of experiences he had. Usually it can be a painful experience and yet doesnt relieve the pain, after not having a massage for a long time. However Jackson was able to relieve the pain and make the whole experience tolerable.

Used to be a regular here (Clementi outlet) but sad to see the deteriorating levels of service and basic etiquette. The staff was constantly chatting and giggling, with zero regard for their customers. Almost felt like they were forced to service us, as they were constantly looking at the clock and were so quick to wind up as soon as the clock hit the hour mark.

I visited this place with my wife.
Did the 1h foot massage ($40) although we just wanted the 30 min. Thanks to the very persistent sales lady. It was too pushy to my liking , keep asking us to upgrade from the service we chose or keep asking us to try some oil even after we said no thanks multiple times.

Massage staff were oki normally polite and did not rush, decent finger pressure and technique.

Ambiance very normal. Grey walls
No music.
No aroma
Not too cold air-cond I like it but some not so.
Chairs were clean and comfy.
Did see the staff spray and sanitise

Kinda strange they asked my wife to sit far away when we the only once there. Well I'll chalk that to covid situation.

Overall I don't think I'll be back  I've tried better. Cheers

Today I took neck, shoulder, back massage, done by Ivy. She didn't use oil for massage, have to pay extra $12 for that.Just massaged on top of my dress. This is not the way of doing this. Sad to say I wasted my $45. I would not recommend this type of massage.. Every penny is valuable, treat every customers same.

A good experience, had the normal neck, back massage, the massage was good, strength was deep tissue kind.. Though we never top up for essential oil, staff respect our choice and was never pushy. Staff were friendly and nice. Staff will sanitize the bed in front of you and also check with masseau if towels were all clean. It's like they will bother to check instead of assuming things were done, so it gives me a piece of mind. Will definitely go back for future massage.

I genuinely enjoy coming to this place for a good massage. This is my 3rd visit, and ive been faithfully served by Ivy who is very skilled!! I did the 45min neck, back and shoulder massage. Ivy always applies just the right amount of pressure and knows precisely the tension points in my muscles to work on. Most of all, i respect her for the effort and great strength she gives everytime (even when I come for a night appointment and she was probably already tired from a whole day of work) Ivy, thank you for making my shoulder and back feel so much better (:!

I went for a massage immediately when Phase 1 started on 19 June as my body was aching from built-up tension accumulated over the time working from home. I did the 4 in 1 feet, neck, shoulder, back package for $50 for 1 hour.

The masseur Andy was skilled and friendly. l left the place with my neck and shoulder and loosened up. l actually felt more relaxed and less tension in my shoulders. Andy also used traditional foot reflexology techniques to release the tension in my shoulder through massaging my feet. We had a enjoyable conversation and l enjoyed the whole experience.

My first visit to this place. I needed a strong massage and my therapist was quick to adjust after I asked for a stronger massage. Definitely one of the better massages I have had in Singapore. My only grievance is the cost. A 90 minute massage costs $85 and youll be asked to add on another $12 if you wish to have an oil massage. Thats a total of $97...more pricey than any other neighbourhood massage places.

So honestly the place wasn't terribly well furnished and there was construction noise that was heard before the massage. The staff were slightly uncoordinated and I heard mild arguing and loud conversations between them several times. Not exactly a tranquil environment. However, the deep tissue massage by Andy was shiok and he wasn't afraid to use his strength to clear the knots in my body. So far the best massage I've had in Singapore.

Highly Recommended
venue for foot massage.

Visited the place multiple times and every single time was satisfying. My favorite go-to venue.

The masseues and masseurs were equally fantastic.
They were friendly, honest, humble, applied adequate/ appropriate conversions/non-conversion during the sessions, skillful and professional.

So far, I have experienced Shu (female), Andy (Male) and Michael (Male).
They were all great in their own ways.
However, I will go to Michael (Tiep) if I have a choice because his style is more suitable for my needs.
His massage method hit the points of my feet that require tension relief.
The strength applied was well balanced and adequate according to my pain endurance threshold and tension relief needs.

Updates as at 20th Oct 2020:
Highly recommended body massage
Michael's (Tiep) body massage was one of the best i ever had.
Pressures were at the right locations i.e. neck, shoulders, back. All tensions were very well relieved.
My go-to body massage also.

Did a 40mins foot reflex and 20mins back and neck - must say one of the best experiences I've had :) Highly recommend Michael for a great strong massage!

Dont understand why so many 5 stars. I had package of 60min foot massage, 30 min back and shoulders for $60, done by a lady. The foot massage was half good, meaning half the time you feel the shiok pain that comes with good foot More

If you need someone with strength call Andy. He is very good with his technique. He ensures that you can take the pressure when he start massaging.

Precious Foot Reflexology (Clementi) is the place! Cozy and quiet ambience. The branch manager was friendly, explaining to us on the definition of reflexology. More

The massage was very uncomfortable. when I requested for alittle more pressure she used all the strength. when I said it was painful she requested to change another of her colleagues to tasked over. It's a total disaster!!! Worst place I have visited! Poor service & very uncomfortable atmosphere throughout!!
