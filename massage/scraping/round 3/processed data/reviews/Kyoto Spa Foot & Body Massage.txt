Ease of making appointment via WhatsApp.
Weekdays Early Bird Promo! - Sure enough, I visited on a Monday morning for Oil Body Massage.
Environments cleanliness is beyond my expectation.
Disposable shorts were used  hygienic.
Initiative to give more attention to pain points and relieve my stiff lower back  customer centric.
Would like to try Hot Stone Massage the next time :)

Great and comfy atmosphere which elevated the experience, making it even more relaxing.  The massage was good, the masseur having good technique and control over the amount of strength put into the massage.  Overall an excellent experience and I would definitely be back again.

Had to wait for 15 minutes past my scheduled slot even though I was on time. Massage was not symmetrical - masseuse massaged the left and the right side of my back and right and left leg differently. No technique at all.

Worst experience ever! No massage points at all. It is not even a massage. It is just someone spreading oil on your back and thats it! Counter staff keep hard selling! Please do not ever go here.

The service staff went all out to help us execute the most memorable surprise for our friends birthday.  They were most obliging, very service oriented and the massage was also excellently relaxing. Well worth every penny we spent ! Thank you Celeste and the masseurs.

Best Massage I have had so far since I came here. My Masseuse was Jolin and she did an amazing job with her techniques. Unlike other spas/massage place, they bundle everything together and not try to sell separately. Worth the time and money.

Will definitely come again!

Had a 1 hour massage yesterday. Massage was strong but soothing. Very relax after the session. Didn't manage to get the masseuse name though. She is quite slim and young looking but strength is there. Kudos to her.

Best massage Ive had so far in Singapore. Cosy, not pushy with overselling services and had soothing music. My massage therapist, Nana was great and had really good massage techniques! Would definitely return.

Room is clean and staff are friendly. Only wish that massage itself was great. It was not too bad but not great either. Just rubbing gently with oil is not a kind of massage I was looking for. Maybe I should have asked for firmer massage. Good luck

Definitely NOT one of the better massages Ive had in Singapore. The masseuse spent the first 45 minutes of my 90-min session forcibly jabbing her elbows into my upper back. Far from relaxing and quite painful. Note to Kyoto staff, massaging via elbows is not comfortable for the  receiver. After that she then lightly massages my legs for 45 minutes without any real care or effort whatsoever. Left quite disappointed. Gave 2 stars for quality of facility.

The environment is comfortable and clean.
My procedure was done by CASS. Very Satisfied!!!
She is obviously exceptionally knowledgeable about the human body and very professional. She made me feel completely comfortable despite the pain and tenderness.
Strongly recommended and I will come back again!!!

Happen to see this nice cosy spa while having lunch at the coffeshop beside it . Took the 1 hour massage at 60 dollar . The ambience of the spa is really good , tranquil n cosy .
A big clean n nicely done up room was assigned to me. I slept throughout the 1 hour massage . Due to the smoothing spa music and skill of the therapist was excellent .  I definitely going back again real soon. Thumb up!
