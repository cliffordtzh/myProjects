First time visit to Massage master from a friends recommendation! Really friendly and professional staff, massage was good and body feels great esp after cupping! Masseuse Jasmine was always checking on me as I had Low tolerance for pain and adjusted the techniques accordingly. Will be patronising more often! Thank you!

I just went to massage master for combi foot and back massage today. The confirmation & booking appointment was fast and upon reaching we( couple) were showed to a private room which was good especially with the current situation when you wish to be away from crowd. Masseuses were professional and the atmosphere in room during the massage was quiet and very relaxing. We fell asleep and thoroughly enjoyed the whole session.

Chinese massage technique (they use a lot of elbows) so for those looking for the usual Thai massage, it is not available here. I personally enjoyed the scrub treatment. The environment is not the best out there but it is decent enough.

Convenient place with ample parking just at the side. The massage is perfect for me. Right strength on the right spots. I always add on the Fire Cupping and its really a wholesome session that makes you feel relaxed and recharged. Highly recommended and price is just right too! Will definitely come back again.

Used to go to this massage place quite often. However, last two visits  were quite bad. Very painful massage throughout and it has became very a noisy place with staff talking among each other loudly along the corridor or on the phone with speaker on. Not going back anymore.

The place is clean and the staff is efficient and courteous. However, if you are looking for a great experience of calm and peace, this is not your place. The rooms are clean and tidy but you often end up hearing the staff chatting up or running along the corridors and it is not the experience which you want while relaxing. Given the price point, there are better parlours around in similar price points.

The lady masseur was grinding my bones using her elbows instead of massaging. Told her twice it was painful, she said ok ok, but soon after she went back to applying her whole body weight. My whole back is feeling so sore now. Worst massage experience ever.

I had some spare time in Singapore so got a 2 & 1/2 hour massage (2 hr package + a foot massage). Massage Master has a nice atmosphere, the staff are helpful (to English only speakers such as myself) and the treatment was relaxing. Sore shoulders from carrying heavy luggage are completely relaxed. Thet are professional & polite. I recommend Massage Master in Bedok as a great place to relax & get excellent customer service.

Went for the couple's massage on the 18th July.
Took a package with a combo of foot massage followed by whole body massage. The ambience and room was great, there's a tv to watch movie while having our foot reflexology. The masseuse was great initially for the body massage but towards the end, for mine, while she was massaging my head, i feel like her pressure force decreasing like as though she fell asleep while massaging. Hahaha.. Another friend who went on a different day before me also mentioned the same! We both went during the night like after 9pm on separate occasions. The masseuse seems tired. Maybe its best to go during the day when they're less sleepy or tired. Also, they're Chinese national, so there's a bit of communication break down coz they don't know much english. If you're going, I recommend being vocal when they're not meeting your expectation. However, overall, it's not that bad.

Location: conveniently located at Simpang Bedok.

Outlet: clean, spacious, with shower facility inside the massage room.

Service: I was served by Irene who gave me a good massage all over my pain points esp my neck area that was stiff. I think Irene is pretty well trained. I've had bad ones from elsewhere and I can definitely differentiate between a good massage vs a bad one.

Actually highly recommended because I was wet from the rain and they let me shower before I commenced the massage. It was very comfortable indeed.

Would go back again definitely since the other plus point is no hard sell! Excellent!

Called and booked a reservation for 2 at 9pm. 20 mins before (alrdy otw there), they called and said reservation is cancelled as there are other customers, so meaning we are not customers? What's the purpose of reservation? Caller told us nvm, just come. We reached on the dot at 9, waited for ard 20-30 mins (alrdy lie down, prepared in the room) still no one came in yet , went to ask estimated time, they tell us another 15 mins at least?! We decided to just cancel and leave, and the receptionist cant even be bothered about us. Wow, worse service ever.

Atmosphere is good. Room is clean. I have been there twice for body massage. First time is a male masseur, his is quite good but his massage style is Malaysia style which I don't really prefer. Second time I requested for China masseur. She is new from China so her style has not been influenced yet, still keeping to her China style massage. She is good, although not the best compared to real massage in China.
I doubt they changed the towel because after massage I always feel my skin is oily. I did not use any oil for my massage so it must be from the towel.

Located in Simpang Bedok, it is convenient with ample parking on the opposite side of the road. Their therapists hail from China & their style is definitely different from Thai massage. Good, deep strokes that reach deep into the muscles. The rooms are spacious enough & very comfortable with proper beds. Very professional. Prices are reasonable too.

But more importantly, the massage actually does work for me. I have been having frequent back and neck aches and stiff because of my stressful desk job. Have been going to other parlours but they have not been effective for me. The massage from this parlour is.
