I was recommended by my close friend to try this shop massage. I went down with another friend recently. Need to book appointment 1st b4 going down as they are quite fully booked. There are a total of 5 masseur, 4 female n 1 male. Aw we had a hr  body massage n it was good. Although it's a bit painful for me, especially the calves, the next day, I felt better n my aches n tightness at my neck area are gone. Totally worth the $$ n will be planning going back fortnightly.

A small establishment with 4 foot reflexology seats. Found the staff to be rather rude during my visit with friends. We were asked to push the foot rest out for our feet wash and the drying towels were thrown to us. Not knowing what to do with the towels, I left the towels on the seat and was told off by one of the staff. Assuming if we are supposed to lay our own towels, shouldn't we be informed in a better way?

No assistance was offered to my girlfriend, who has trouble reaching the foot rest to dry her feet after her foot wash. They were nonchalant to see her struggling.

This is the place to go if you aren't bothered by service.

$16 for 30mins foot reflexology. Do note this is for appointment before 8pm, otherwise it is $20 for 30mins.

Only cash payment available.

A no-frills, no-nonsense, 100% value place. This is where I've had the best foot massage in Singapore. I fall asleep every time, it is that relaxing!
The body massage is also great. The pressure is more on the firmer side, but I always find all aches and pains gone afterwards.
The best part is the consistent excellent service no matter who your therapist is. There is one Aunty in particular (unfortunately I don't know her name), who works magic and makes your pain disappear.
The only thing I'd say is that sometimes it is a bit hard to communicate, because everyone does not have the same proficiency in English. But it doesn't matter really as the staff always find a way to get their meaning across regardless. :) I'm a happy repeat customer for the last 3 years.

Price is decent for a proper traditional massage! They know what what their doing and will tackle all your problem areas. If youre looking for a pretty spa type of place, this isnt for you. But if you need to a no-frills deep massage, this is exactly what Dong Bei is about.

I have been consistently going to Dongbei for tuina sessions for the past few years. The tuina sessions are spot on and alleviates my pain and sore spots. Very value for money,no frills massage sessions, focused on healing your problematic areas. Highly recommend.

Value for money and tui na is good!
However dont expect spa standard.. is more traditional tui na and place is not as lavish like spa parlours.

(Translated by Google) Because there are 4 sofas and there are only females
You can leave the treatment.
I had my knees tightly massaged from my fingertips with a slightly cool cream.
I am very tired from walking when I go on a trip, but I am very pleased with this massage.

(Translated by Google) I can only get a foot massage here. It is so near to the center of the Mustafa, but it is too cool, and it is chirpy to the head. Fatigue flew into one room.
