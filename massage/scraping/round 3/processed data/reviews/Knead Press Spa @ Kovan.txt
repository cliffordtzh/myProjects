My first visit to Knead Press Spa yesterday,  after reading all the positive reviews.  It turned out to be a good experience.

Michelle manning the counter was very detailed in her explanation,  letting me know the key features of the various types of massage.

Sally,  my masseur was very skilled and detailed and covered all my pain points appropriately.

The part I like about Knead Press Spa is they do not hard sell.  This is unlike many of their competitors in the industry.

Will definitely visit again.

My first time here. Got Lisa to massage. I went for the oriental oil massage but after she realized I play sports so suggested I top up a little to do the sports deep tissue. It was good. She wasn't hard selling after all. I felt so much more relaxed and back muscle was less tense after. Kudos! The tea after the massage was so good too!

Hubby and I went for a 90mins deep tissue massage and it was totally worth the price. Jasmine and Lisa are really good and professional masseuses.
I had chronic pain on my left shoulder all the way to my neck and left arm which I told Jasmine, and she really put in extra effort to break all the muscle knots on my problematic areas. I haven't felt so light in a very long time!
Lisa worked on my husband, and he also felt all the muscle pain around his shoulder and neck became much much better after the massage.
Definitely will go back!

Was there a couple of nights ago for 12am slot. Recall to reschedule to 12.30am and I agreed. I arrived 10minutes early and waited till 12.50am for my turn. Took up 2hr massage and didn't mind the wait as the receptionist was apologetic. The massage for first 30minutes was good, then came the nightmare. The masseuse kept falling asleep every 5 minutes. How do I know because The motion of pressing stopped and no movement. Then came, the oil massage part. Throughout the massage it felt like someone just rubbing the hands against my skin and the masseuse kept falling asleep every few minutes and it was so obvious. When she was about to start massaging my legs, I told masseuse to stop and informed that I wanted to go to toilet. Instead, I changed and left. I feedbacked to the receptionist about what happened as it was unacceptable and requested for their manager to call me but up until now no calls were made by them. Their Google reviews were good and maybe I was unlucky. This will be the first and last time I will go here.

My first visit - experience was very good.
Staff - receptionist: She was lovely efficient polite patient and excellent!  Unfortunately the first masseuse who entered and is from China - was very unpleasant. She insisted that I do Sports instead of Oriental which I had selected, and she speaks very loudly in Chinese ( I was having a migraine )... very stubborn and annoying.  The receptionist came to my rescue and changed to another masseuse and I must say : SHE IS AWESOME!! I extended my massage from 1hr to 90mins... that is how good she was. Knead deserves 5*!

Don't understand where all the good reviews come from but maybe we are just unlucky. It's our first time but also the last. Given a smelly couple room that reeks of toilet sewage (eventhough they have air filter but wasn't turned on). And my bed sheet didn't seem fresh, there was a stench. .. My masseuse was a young lady (didn't bother to find out her name) and unprofessional. She tried to push for the more expensive hot oil massage and when i rejected, she was rude and techniques were lazy and inconsistent. Throughout the 90 mins session, her attitude made me feel like she didn't want to be working here, it's as if she's sick and tired of being a masseuse. So it was a dreadful session where i couldn't feel relaxed or pampered.

Lastly, the lobby area looks clean with a friendly receptionist but when you walk to the back area to access the toilet, it's wet, dirty, messy and run down yucks. Someone needs to step up on the hygiene. For the price point, it's more like my neighbourhood foot massage experience than a spa one. Trust me, you can get better experience elsewhere with the money paid.

In a locality that is literally peppered with 'spas' and 'parlors' catering to a certain group of clientele, its refreshing to find a proper and legitimate massage parlor that is Knead Press. Was recommended by a relative and came here on a particularly tiring day. Lady receptionist was very welcoming and explained the menu options. Had a Chinese therapist by the name of Lisa and oh boy was she amazing at relieving the various dull aches in my back. I left feeling very refreshed and have since returned on a few other occasion whenever I am in need of a hard rub. Props to the management for keeping the establishment clean and professional. This is definitely a place in Kovan area that you can bring your significant other along without receiving any kind of indecent proposal from the masseuse.

I experienced the deep tissue sports massage. Always have issues with the muscles around the scapula, particularly the rhomboids and trapezius. This is probably the first time I have had anyone (Sally was my therapist) pressing the correct pain points around this area, with the right pressure, sequencing and duration. Highly recommended.

Booked for sports massage $98/90mins for 2 pax 11am today. At reception, we saw other types of massages and thought to change to another type of massage but the lady at the counter told us that we already booked for the $98 one. We asked if we cant change to something else since we havent paid anything? she said not say cannot. But emphasized again massages $98/90 mins or $128/90 mins is better. Another masseur came and patiently explained the different types of massages and identify our personal needs. One of us decided to switch to the normal $80/90 mins traditional massage instead, at this point the lady at reception nudged the masseuse and pointed out to her that we booked the $98 one. So do book correctly the massage you want beforehand as you can only upgrade but not downgrade.

My therapist is Sally. She is very professional. Knowing that my back is very stiff, and could not be resolved by rendering the normal Oriental Oil massage I have selected, she initially recommended me to upgrade to a more effective option, but I didn't agreed initially, thinking it may be sales tactics to generate more revenue. After that, she recommended me to switch to the 2 hour Oriental Oil massage to 1.5 hours Oriental Oil + 30mins Herbal Mud Treatment for the same price. After the therapy, I feel a lot more relaxed. Highly recommended. Thanks Sally.

Had a massage with Sally. It was disappointing as there was hardly any pressure with her kneads and this could hardly be qualified as a massage.

The management explained that this would be what I get for going for the basic massage - Oriental Oil Massage. That means, the more a customer pays, the more efforts and pressure the customer will get. Otherwise, one will just have to make do with this lackluster standard.

Yes, it is true that they don't hard sell. Yet, by using this method, they are getting customers to go for more expensive massages.

I wont be patronising this spa anymore.

The first two times I came here, I felt the massage was quite good with the 90mins-$128 massage package. This time i came back and wanted to experience a different kind of massage, so i chose the 90mins-$75 package.
The staff who just entered the room asked me if I've been here before, and always do this massage package?
I said: I've been here and took the $128 package previously.
Masseur : why did you take that package last time and now change to this ?
Me: I just want to experience and try other things.
Then she said nothing and started the massage.
Pressed for a while, she said that my body is too hard, asked if I want to change to the $128 package?  and just like that she pressed for a while (no energy in the massage) and continued to say that the package should be changed, during the massage she kept advising me to change the package.  even though I said no.
Feeling rather annoyed, I wanted to change people.
Also, near the end I wanted to get a head massage, she said that this package can't have a head massage?  This is the worst experience for me.
So i changed from 5 stars to 1 star.

Was introduced by a friend to come over as I was feeling lethargic due to tension on my neck & shoulders.

Sally was the masseuse that attended to me.

I went for deep tissue massage as well as herbal mud treatment. Money well spent, tension on my neck & shoulders are relieved. Masseuse is experienced and knows that I do not like forceful massages without me needing to tell her.

Definitely coming back again.

Ps, an advanced booking is required especially on weekends.

Came here to try for it's 4.9 star review.

But I did not enjoy their service and  didn't manage to get the back relieve I wanted. After payment within the room masseuses said normal Swedish massage couldn't help with my shoulder and back discomfor because their swedish massage only include 10min shoulder back, 10mins hand leg and balance of the time is just rub oil. Then asked me to add on additional for change to deep muscle massage. I have much better experience from many other parlours. So I don't recommend.

They provide a free bottle of massage oil if u write a good review on the Google.

Sally is very strong but She can calibrate her strength according to your threshold for pain. Body feels less stiff after 120min of twisting and aggressive kneading. Will return to try other massages.

Did a 1 hour deep tissue massage with Lisa, which was great! Came in with a stiff upper back and Lisa really helped to ease the tension. Would recommend

Did an hour of deep tissue massage with Sophia, massage was thorough and she applied the right amount of pressure, felt really relieved. Keep up the good work! Will be back again. Jasmine tended to my wife and we felt that they always made sure we were comfortable and relaxed throughout the massage.

First time here and had the sports deep massage. This massage had more focus on the back which I preferred. Told Nico about my lower back ache and felt better after her help.

Have been a regular since I discovered it last month. Visited again and did sports deep tissue and head massage with Sally. The session was very relaxing and helped a lot with the sore from long time working at desk and deep squat. Highly recommend!

Lisa was very experienced in sharing with me the areas that I was feeling aching. Was feeling aching before, did the sports deep tissue and felt much relaxed after!

My go-to fav massage place so far.

Can always trust my massseur, Kris, to give me a good relaxation session whenever i needed the relief from the aches. Kris is patient with my request and friendly and able to hit my sore spots perfectly. She is your go to masseur if u needed a good session!

You can have a quick shower with their shower facilities in the room, which is very great option for visit after work!

My fav is the 'lower back and stomach' for 1.5 hours which is just nice to good refresh on my muscles. apparently this and the lymphatic massage requires most of the healing techniques required. but the lymphatic one can be a little more painful due to its nature. so those like me cannot take pain one can try lower back and stomach(includes whole body actually, not just lower back and stomach). Best recovery option I feel and as recommended to me by the lady boss.

As they are open till 4AM! you can always go there after 10pm which is really convenient  Just call to book it at least 1 or 2 hours earlier to secure ur slot to avoid disappointment.

Did the Oriental oil massage by Nicole and surprisingly good, they are very skilled and pressed the right acupuncture points. Believe they are professionally trained; great stress and body relief. Lychee drink served at the end. Yum!

First time here for the sports massage based on the recommendations. Did 1 hour with Jasmine and it was really good in reducing the strain in my shoulders as I play racket sports regularly. Highly recommended for those looking for a good recovery sports massage.

I go for massages regularly and this is not an exaggeration but Sally is probably one of the best masseuses I've ever had. She is skilful and thorough, and she doesn't miss any sore spots at all. I feel a ton looser after an hour with her. More

Did a heated oil massage for 90mins. My therapist was Lisa and she was very thorough throughout the session. Good stretch and good strength.

Sports Deep Tissue by Jasmine is highly recommended. She may seem small but full of energy.
Her skills were very important to releasing knots and tight muscles.

Whilst hunting for a massage place that opens till late, managed to chance upon Knead Press and I am very happy with the massage experience! Amy was a great masseuse and I enjoyed the massage session thoroughly. Looking forward to the next massage already :)
