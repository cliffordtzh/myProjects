Went for a 90-min massage with my wife, and we got a 2-pax room to ourselves. Very professional masseuses, and reminded us of those good ones we used to frequent in China. Reasonable pricing for massages in SG so nothing to complain there.. definitely will go back there again if possible

Went with my boyfriend today and we were genuinely pleased! We requested for the couple room and got it easily. The area was super clean and cozy. The whole massage went smoothly and the masseuse were very nice and massaged well. Didnt catch their names but thank you for the great service! Looking forward to come again.

Recently tried to book in a new massage but no one is answering the call at 5pm in the evening. I'm surprised that there is still no online booking, and the reservations need to be via the call. The online website is unclear as it doesn't provide the clear details of the services provided. For example, coming from an Indian background, I have no idea what Ba Guan and Gua Sha therapy is. I had to look it up separately to understand the services being offered. Please add in the details of this so that people from all backgrounds can understand the services you're offering.

Last time I visited was a while back. Over the phone, I had asked the receptionist of the differences in the services provided, but she didn't offer clear answers. I was also disappointed to find out that that the timing for the 4 in 1 massage couldn't be customised and had to opt for Swedish Massage instead. The room when I entered was still wet on the floor from the previous customer, which I didn't notice until I actually stepped on the water. I tried to indicate this to the masseuse but she didn't understand what I was telling her.

The massage in itself was good, but my experience was tarnished by these mistakes and I wasn't able to enjoy it as much. I came back because I had a good first time experience, but my second time wasn't as good. I'm hoping the service and the online portal improves in the future.

I recommend booking in advance as it is a popular place, and for good reason: the welcome is warm, the atmosphere is tranquil and relaxing, and the massage therapists are strong, skilled and professional.
I felt a bit cold during my massage but the therapist perceived it and offered to change the A/C temperature.
I was served a nice hot cup of sweet ginger tea at the end. Very nice indeed!

Went for foot massage last week. Its super comfy and clean. The masseur, Candice use the right strength.  Before they start, it has this herbal foot soak where you soak in for a while while they give a 5min shoulder massage. The chair is also comfortable which allows to be recline back. Now without JB to go to, I think I will patronise a bit more often especially after tense day wfh.

Although my first experience was alright, I came here again for a second time hoping for a better experience. I must say that Annie has done a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the massage! Will definitely come back again :)

-------------Previous review-----------
3 stars for the service, attitude and ambience. The masseur was really nice and adjusted to my requests, however for some reason she just couldnt hit my trigger points :/ the next morning when I woke up, the soreness in my neck got worse instead (and I know its not the kind of soreness that is normal after a massage)... Its a shame because I really wanted to like this place given all the good reviews it had. I might or might not return for another try with a different masseur.

Went a few times with my husband, and each time our expectations were met. My hubby always visit them whenever he has tightness and aching on his calf from running, and each time, Annie manage to relief the tightness on his calf. Love the ambience and glad that linens are changed for each turnover. Always looking forward to visiting them!

Expected great service because of the number of positive reviews online, and the printed reviews on the menu. But the masseuse was rather rude with her replies to me. Did not enjoy my massage as the masseuse was thumb-heavy making it uncomfortable. Would not return to this outlet in future.

Been coming to this place for the past 4 years. Many masseuses have come n gone. At the moment my favorite is May, whos frm Thailand. If you like massage done with hands n arms (vs elbow), shes the one to get! Shes very polite n genuine, n motherly too! You can state your preferences or area of concentration before the massage starts, n she will surely comply very nicely.

Came here with my husband & my therapist Fiona is incredible! She uses a lot of strength & has good techniques to target your tight spots. Seems sincere & hardworking, would recommend for all to look for her.

On the other hand, the therapist for my husband was inappropriate. Kept making conversation even if it was clear we preferred to enjoy the service in silence. Also, she playfully slapped my husbands feet when he cracked a joke which seemed highly inappropriate to me.

Had a persistent and nagging sore shoulder for several weeks and decided to come here a  massage treatment.

The massage treatment was solid (10/10 rating) - good amount of pressure, firm stroke and laser like precision on where to focus on, not only for my shoulder but for my thighs and neck as well.

Definitely will be back again! This is one of the rare instance I think the value far exceed the price. At 55 this is a steal. Very tempted to invest in a package.

And last but not least, my masseur name is May. Her massage was so good I just feel obligated to give her a shout-out here.

Thank you!

I left in awe, indeed over my expectation. Very nice warmth welcome at the receptionist, room given to me was huge with relaxing vibes. Massage therapist is from thailand, very professional, no sales talk, great massage with the right strength, very dedicated. What is more surprising was that after the ginger tea, i can go freely, no need to endure sales talk to sign packages. Feeling superb rejuvenated! Thank you !

I recently tried this place for the first time and will certainly come back, as it was a pleasant experience from beginning to end. I felt comfortable right from the moment I stepped in, with the nice deco and the cleanliness of the place. Then, my massage was done by a skilled therapist, who definitely knew what she was doing. The massage table was also comfortable with no discomfort on the forehead. Finally, there was a nice ginger tea served with a nice dessert. Given the competitive pricing for this, I think this is really worth it.

If you want a mind blowing body massage, look no further this is the place to go! So happy I found my massage go to spot, have visited twice so far and both experiences were equally excellent. You will not find a better deal elsewhere with their Tuesday ladies promotion for the type of high quality masseurs they have. My favourite masseur is QiQi - her massage skills and technique really hits every sore and painful spot! Cant wait to be back again!

I just finished a body massage in this branch and immediately felt like I should write this review. Great massage, pressures just right. The therapist could speak better English than most parlors. The pace was rather slow but thorough. Nice touch after session, with the warm green bean soup and hot Chinese tea as refreshments.

Paid a visit for the first time today because of the ongoing Sep promo for ladies and am really satisfied :)

Lady at the counter is polite. My masseuse (Fiona) constantly checked if I was in pain or wanted her to exert more strength. She also massaged only shoulders/back as per my request. Very professional and thoughtful service, will definitely return!

Also, they served ginger tea and a bowl of dessert after the massage  Location is also quite convenient, just a few steps away from opp queensway shopping ctr bus stop

3 of us went to Han Dynasty (Alexandra) last night after reading all positive comments online, but our experience is not as good as what Ive read online. During the process I always say it hurts and make it softer but the pressure is all the same until the end of the massage. Though last night after the massage I still havent felt the pain, but today, I cant even move properly as my whole body is aching as if I went to the gym and had intense exercise. My body is sore from shoulder down to my legs. Same sentiments with the other 2 who came with me last night. I went there for relaxation but didnt receive a relaxing massage which is very disappointing.

I like about this place is the quietness and good service. The place is new and spacious.

The foot reflexology room that I was directed is a couple's room. You can relax and enjoy the session with your partner un-disturbed. TV & music in the room as well.

The Oriental massage is good. Masseur has the strength to get the job done professionally.

Try it out if you are nearby and feedback your experience.

Make sure to make reservation, even if you plan to go late in the night. Good service, but not everyone speaks English so if you have problem areas for massage please Ensure you speak to the front desk and communicate to the masseuse. They offered us red bean sweet cuz we did not make reservation and had to wait for 30 mins.

It was my gf's first visit. On arrival, she was shocked that the shop did not bother to get her to fill in any indemnity form like other spa places would, nor bothered to ask her areas of concern. She asked to do gua sha, but the assigned masseur decided on her behalf that she was not suitable. There was no room for negotiation. To dissuade my gf from doing gua sha, the masseur proceeded to scrap my gf's back hard, without any accompanying oil nor cream applied during a gua sha.  My gf then asked about the indemnity form, and masseur got her to get dressed again (note: she has been asked to change out by now). Twice,masseur went into the room without permission, and left the door opened exposed to the corridor. A truly horrifying experience. Though the shop tried to make it up to her by sending anlyher masseur and having the countrt staff do thejr job properly, she was too scarred to contemplate a return trip.

I've provided a 5 stars review 3 months ago and it's still stand for the masseurs service. However, the service of your receptionists is getting worst these days.

When I called between 10:30am - 10:50am to make appointments, it's hardly anyone pick up the phone and I have to Whatsapp masseurs to check availability.

What really triggered me to write this was, I've made an appointment with Zii (finally someone picked up the phone), the receptionist said she would call me if Zii cannot come to work; Guess what? I only knew Zii was not able to make it till I physically walked in your shop as the receptionist cannot bother to call me. I cannot change to another masseur as she is the expert for prenatal massage

You really need to pick up your game in terms of customers communication, maybe investing in a digital solution for making appointment to reduce unnecessary human errors.

Super lucky to have the best masseur in walking distance. I have been with Alice for nearly two years, she is so magical and can always fix my back and neck tension precisely.

The hot brown sugar ginger tea is also authentic and effective, I feel all the humidity was sweated out from my body after drinking it with a good massage.
