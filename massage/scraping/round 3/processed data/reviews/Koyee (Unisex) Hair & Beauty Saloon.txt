Have enjoyed every massage session ive had so far. Be it a foot reflexology or body rub-down.. the therapists here are polite and skillful. Knowing exactly where the pressure points are. They are also sensitive to your body's response to the pressure they exert. Prices are reasonable too.
Reservations are advised for weekends.
