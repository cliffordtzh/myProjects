I have used their services for the past few years and the store has recently undergone a renovation. There is only space for 3 reflexology clients and 2 massage beds which meant you have to make a booking prior to your visits. I like it because there is space to move around and you are not cramped together. The masseurs are skilled and friendly and know how to untie knots in your body and feet. They have a membership package but they don't push it aggressively. Highly recommended.

Have been a member since 2018.
Renewed over the years. Never trusted neighborhood massage parlour much but tried on this one the 1st time back in 2018. Never regret my decision to join member ever since then.

Friendly and approachable staff. From senior team leader Gary, to senior staff David, Iqa, Ah Meng, and Uncle Ken. Ex staff, Sam. We know them all too well.

Their skills all differs yes, definitely. Some are new some are seniors. No doubt, all their skills and knowledge are good in terms of pressure points, pressure applied, understanding of muscles aches, advices on health, are acceptably good.

Some people may not like it, but its personal preference really. We love it, not only because of their painful massage which works but their warm welcome hospitality and service towards all their customers.

I very much enjoyed the attention to detail when adjusting various parts of the body and stretching or massaging based on whats needed, and in a way that can actually help your pain points feel better. In comparison to other massages shop, my experience here felt way more therapeutic and the most important factor is the price is reasonable.

I highly recommend and will definitely be returning! Thanks to my masseuse Mr Gary

Saw 90 over 5 star reviews and was eager to try. Sadly the experience paled in comparison. Opted for an hour body as my body was aching from sports.

Strength was good but didn't quite hit the right spots. Pressure applied was inconsistent towards the 2nd half of the massage. She barely used any strength when massaging the left it band area. Right calf, hip and it band was skipped for some unknown reason.

Will return for a massage by the widely praised Mr Gary next time. Hope to get a better experience and will update this review

This is a place I always will visit as it relaxed me when I have some sleeping & headache issues. The masseur, Gary is able to help in releasing the tiredness. Besides, with my leg condition, the masseur is also able to find the pressure point to release the pressure. All the staff are friendly, helpful and thoughtful. I enjoyed every session and will visit minimally 1 time a month. Strongly recommend to visit this shop. Massagez Kaki Wellness

Gem spot in woodlands  Spotted this place after covid hit Singapore and crossing the border is not allowed anymore. Glad that I have found this place to ease my backache since WFH has actually caused longer working hours. No hard selling and pricing is reasonable! Decided to be a member after several visits. I prefer massuer with more strength so usually I will find Gary or Ah Ming  Friendly and their skills never disappoint me

I've searched high and low for massage that actually goes into the muscle and not just piano massage. The staff here give real massage and a re very professional. Mr Gary is exceedingly good and should be given a raise. The female staff are equally adept. I have very bad legs due to sports and they've managed to fix my issues. Can finally feel blood circulation again. I stumbled upon them and have been back more than 5 times.

This is the right place for leg massage. Ever since I came here to try the leg massage, I will make sure every week I will come here at least once. Especially when I do vigorous workout like tabata.
Walk in possibility quite slim cos their schedule quite packed. Unless you want to wait for some time. If wanna come I will suggest you to make an appointment.

Booked an appointment on the day itself.  Experience it for the first time it was so good. He hit on the right point at my legs and upper back which was painful. Good to give a trial for first timer at $38. Subsequently, I signed on the  member package because it was so much worth it. Go go try!  I felt more relaxed after. Most important are staffs are soo friendly!

Went down for the first trial $38 for 40min foot and 20min massage, and was welcomed very warmly by the staff Ah Meng. 888 plaza shop was simple and cosy with 3 foot massage chairs and 3 beds, and 1 shoulder massage chair. Our masseuses were Ah Zhen and Ikah, who were both excellent and targeted all the right points. We have been to many massage shops in Singapore and were blown away by the level of expertise, and immediately signed up as members ($68 for one year and includes a free 40min body + 40min foot massage). We really appreciate how honest this business is ran, as they do not sell packages and the membership scheme is perfect for regulars who can get some savings without spending a bomb to  buy a package. Prices are very reasonable too!

Saw good reviews thus made an appt for the outlet at 888 plaza as I reali needed Tuina for my stiff shoulder... It was my 1st time there n staff was polite... Had opted for the Combo $38 which was for 20mins back n 40mins leg then staff asked if I prefer 30/30 cos it's near to closing time which I said OK since is total 60mins anyway... Ended up paying 48 instead cos they said 30/30 is another combo which I wasn't even informed B4 hand so it juz doesn't seem honest to me thou he said sorry he forgot to tel me ... Not only I had to pay more for nth it seems to make my shoulder worse.. Shoulder was stil so stiff n hurts so much that I couldn't slp well for past 2 days n ya now I have to spend another amount to visit another Tuina master...
