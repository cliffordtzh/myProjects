Been here a few times, each time i was satisfied with their service. They are able to produce hand written receipts. For parking there were minimal parking spaces, for bikes there are only 2 lots around there. Staff were friendly. There were even off peak prices available for those who wish to avoid crowds. The masseuses are skilful and good. I dont know their names but I did not have to ask for specific masseuse to enjoy my massages. Pocket friendly as well. Would recommend this place!

I have been here many times and attended by many masseuse. I must say firstly the price is pretty good as it is at the lower end of the market rate for a 1hr full body massage.

Secondly, the masseuse i recommend is Nana. The spots she massages and the amount of strength is just right for me as this is a deep tissue massage and she always hits the right spots with the right strength

Came with wife for 1.5hrs massage. The counter and therapist were polite and friendly. The massage was average and didnt hit the right spots. Sadly, the room wasnt well kept and towel has a little musky smell.

Place smells damp, musty and looks tired. Masseuse lacks experience but has strength. While waiting for my friend to finish, spotted a baby roach near the seating area. There are slightly cheaper and better quality massage places for less than $80 for 90 mins nearby Upper Thomson.

Super love it!! Came a few times with my hubby, decided to bring my mum and auntie for a massage & hot stone therapy as they have been experiencing body ache for sometimes. I am glad that they enjoy the massage session here. By the way, i love their peppemint and lemongrass oil its so aromatic feel in the room. And the counter staff is very helpful and friendly too. One side note is their behind car park can be limited slot at times. Definitely will come back again soon!

Visited Ancient Dynasty Thomson branch on 3 April, Saturday. Read that this place has affordable and good massage so decided to give it a try. Was looking forward to the massage since my shoulders have been aching for days.

Boy did I regret my decision. The moment my masseuse came in and put the towel over my back, I knew she was just doing it for the sake of it. Everything was done in a rush. I booked for an hour of whole body massage but left the place not feeling any better. Masseuse don't even know where are the areas to massage as she was pressing close to my spine. I thought this was by accident so I kept quiet. Then she did it again when she was pressing my lower back.

Never returning to this place ever again.

Disappointed! First & the last visit here.

Went on a non-peak period, Tuesday midnight to be exact.. Family of 5pax. To be honest it was a last minute thing so had no choice as other places were fully booked.
We have been patronizing the other outlet at Siglap and it was really good, even after midnight but sadly it was full.
Smooth booking and receptionist is friendly.
Four of us had the usual Deep Tissue Massage for 90 mins and another 1 of us had the foot massage.
Overall checked with the rest ~ Their massage was also as bad as mine. :(
So here's what happened during my 90 mins massage;
1) Aircon was too cold.
2) For the whole 1 hour plus was like a "slow motion" kind of massage as I guess she was taking her own sweet time to pass the time..
3) 90% - Forearm and elbow , 10% - Pressure using hands/fingers (this 10% were only used during the last 15 to 20 mins time nearing to the end when I was lying facing up.)
4) Forearm was used to press and slide across my body just like how you spread the kaya on your bread but this one is using Forearm and Oil instead.
5) Elbow was pressed down at different parts of my body for at least 20-30 seconds each time. (Yes I counted as the clock on the wall is ticking just beside me.)
7) She pressed in between my thumb and second finger so hard that it's painful as I was typing the review now.
8) And ya, I was supposed to wipe off the excess oil all over my body as it was self service I supposed.

Just to highlight, it's not my first time going for a massage and I would normally go for a massage at least once or twice in a month (at other places).
I'm not a review kind of person but I really felt cheated and just wasted $375 for all 5 of us.
Came with a tired and sore body but came back with a painful experience. :(

I would like to compliment both my therapists for me and my husband (Mika & Jamie) i had at Ancient Dynasty. I have a super ached lower back and shoulder pain due to long seating of hours and using of laptop. I cant take the pain and insomnia for a few days already, so went to search for some good and value for money spa i have decided to call in and make an appointment with them. Its was a simple, cozy place and humble individual treatment room, what i like is its a door type not a curtain type. Which i felt its more privacy , next come to the massage its really really good at least for me i feel so much better. To be honest, its pain at times but my therapist explain to me why its pain due to muscle tension and i will feel the sore for the next few days for recovery purposes. Personally feel is that best to communicate with them which area or any issue you would like to address. End of the massage i felt lighter and better, and they have ginger tea and red date tea too. I would definitely recommend them to my family and friends as they open late too which is a super good choices for me. Thank you ancient dynasty team at thomson branch. Last note, they never hard selling any packages and very friendly staff. ;)

The masseuse here not professional at all. Massage shoulder also like piano, no power at all, just plain lazy. After the whole session, still feel shoulders very sore and tight. After massage, warm Water just put on the table at the entrance of the shop. Go to Healing Touch instead, dont waste your time and money here.

If I could I would give it 0 stars for horrible booking service. My husband and I booked a massage at their Upper Thomson branch, went for our appointment on time (and with proof of booking) only to find out another couple was given our slot. Staff (Sheryl) refused to demand for proof of booking from the other couple as she didnt want to disturb them while taking their massage. If they could not provide proof of booking, she could have rightly asked them to leave the premises as they had taken our slot but she didnt want to. Cant speak for the masseuses skills as we werent able to experience them.

Been coming to this place since 2014/15, and had just finish my relaxing massage. So far all the therapists are quite skillful and the price is really good @$68 for 1.5 hrs. I've recommended a few friends here and they commented it's relaxing. One of them even tell me, it's one of the few places that he will fall asleep during massage. If you need stronger massage just let the therapist knows.

Masseuse isn't as professional as the ones in the past. Not greeted at the entrance after massage session is completed and plainly leave the drink at the table. Paid $80 for 1.5 hours massage on a weekend during off peak period.

This used to be my favorite place for massage. I have come here several times over two years. I had introduced this place to other people as well. But in recent times, the standard for massage has really dropped. I did notice that alot of the masseurs that I used to see working here, aren't anymore. Not sure if it's due to Covid. Gave this place one more chance today despite my bad experience there last month and I regretted it. Both me and my boyfriend shared the same sentiments when we were done, that our masseurs did not seem to know what they were doing. My masseur just used her forearm through the entire massage and barely used pressure. When I did ask her to press harder, she seemed annoyed and she jammed her elbow on my back and pressed her whole body weight and didn't stop even when I was visibly struggling under her. I gasped and told her to stop. I gave up then and kept quiet through the entire massage. I now have big bruises on my back. Never coming back again.

Went there with my boyfriend had a 90mins massage and we both walked out with satisfaction. Some places I went to made me feel like the masseurs had no energy at all. Ancient dynasty was different, they made sure the pressure was right for you and they could go from firm to gentle depending on your needs. My partner forgot his necklace there so they rang him to let him know, very honest people I must say!!!

If you dislike massage parlour that hard sells, then this is a shop that is not to be missed. The therapist is professional and will constantly adjust the pressure that is suitable for you. I paid $95 for a 2-hour massage with a premium top up for peppermint oil. This place provides value-for-money massage service. However, if you are looking for a high-end boutique style place, then it may not be your cup of tea.

Went with my husband and the massage we had at Ancient Dynasty was the most therapeutic deep tissue massage we've ever experienced. My massage was a perfect mixture of deep tissue and Swedish. We were so satisfied with the service that we scheduled another couples massage 2 days later. We highly recommend these massage therapist!

I went there as my lower back was very sore, I had tweaked it a few days earlier. I asked them to recommend a massage to help with this, which they did and before starting the massage the masseuse confirmed with me which area to focus on. They recommended Deep tissue massage which was very good and helped a lot in reducing my back pain. Will definitely come back again

Have been a returning customer for several years, began my journey here with a foot massage, then full body massage then add on with hot stone as well. Have never looked back since then!
The team is professional, sincere, and friendly. No hardselling involved. Options are laid out for you, be informed but no obligations at all.
Spoilt and pampered by their excellent services and massages.

While it may not be the best massage service i had, the overall service and friendliness i recieve was excellent. Its definately one of the cheapest good massage you can find in Singapore.
The environment is quiet with smoothing music, exactly what i was looking for after a long day work in office. Kudos to the management for the masseur i was appointed, really good as i requested one with strong hands for my back and neck.
I will definitely return and recommend for the price and overall services.
