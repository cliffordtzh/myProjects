Pros :

- They accommodate to my requests as I was afraid of pain, and they were super super gentle with me

- Easy payment such as PayNow!

- Comfortable and peaceful place. Chairs were not torn or worn out like other massage places!

- Budget pricing , damn good!  Way cheaper than other places

Cons :

- Place is very plain, there were no nice lightings , no decorations . Just massage chairs and bed .

- Aircon is there but I personally prefer it to be stronger lol

- There was no music , like those typical spa calming music on speakers :(

Overall, I'm quite happy with their services. Will come back again! 
I hope they can install speakers and play calm spa music soon ! Looking forward to it to my next visit

Tried 60 minutes body massage. I wouldnt really recommend it to anyone. It was a male therapist. He has the strength, but maybe lack the techniques. Each time he tried to apply pressure on a single accupoint, he was unable to apply it properly. Sometimes, he was also unable to find the right massage points to deliver the effect of releasing tension on the shoulders. Its a pity.
