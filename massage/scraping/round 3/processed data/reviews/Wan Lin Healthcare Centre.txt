Authentic and professional massage.
The masseur was really skillful and able to effectively relieve the tensions in my muscles, especially the tension knots around my neck and shoulders. Also, the environment was really clean and gives off a really relaxing and comfortable vibe.

Overall, a truly enjoyable massage experience. Highly recommend!

Awesome massage experience at WanLin. I wear heels and go to the gym often and was experiencing aching on my soles. I also have stiff neck as a result of poor ergonomics during WFH.

The masseuse really eased the knots in my body. Appreciated the fact that the place was really easy to locate and environment is relaxing with lots of antiques as well.

Plus point is that I can charge my phone there while I enjoy the foot massage.

Highly recommended :) !

I had a lot of muscle knots and stiffness in my back and shoulders which the masseuse was able to rub them out. Been to quite a few massage places before but many of them werent able to fully rub them out for me. For once, I didnt even have to ask the masseuse to use strength and he was able to rub them out properly with the right amount of strength. He was able to isolate and pin point my affected areas without even telling him about it. Sadly, I didn't get his name as I had to rush off. Overall, I wasn't expecting anything but I think Ive found my new go-to massage place now :) The service was great and the masseuse kept asking me if the strength was okay. 10/10 recommend

We did 40-min foot reflexology and 20-min shoulder + back massage with 2 female masseuses and it was amazing, relieving us of our feet, neck and shoulder aches. The environment is clean and comfortable too and I foresee returning for regular sessions. That said, my friend and I realised that our masseuses both appeared exhausted working through the evening, and one mentioned they didn't have time to go for proper meals that day. As much as I like the ease of having multiple time slots to book online, it'd be nice to see well-rested masseuses with sufficient break and meal times. Perhaps the management could look into improving the welfare of their masseuses. Happy workers, happy vibes for customers too.

Took a 60min full body massage and was assigned a masseur. Masseur was knowledgeable, hands were strong, technique was good as well. Masseur focused more on my neck as I have a very stiff neck and shoulder. Will be back next time to focus on my lower back. Highly recommended!

Very good masseur can be found here, had a 1 hour body massage with Lin. She is so good and experience, and helped to relieve for all the tension i believe i had in my muscles or whole body. She can literally pinpoint the areas that need more attention in after i mentioned the pains i had during massage. Had a very good sleep thereafter. Highly recommended. Thank you Lin =)

My go-to massage place. My mom is a regular here and was the one who introduced me to this joint after some of my bad experiences at some other local massage chains. I go to school nearby and came here one day after a horrible 4-hour headache that left me in agony throughout my entire lecture-filled day. A quick 1-hour session with a request for the auntie who did my massage to focus on my tense back and neck did MAGIC. I swear.

I come here now with my bf who is a chef and on his feet all day, and he feels rejuvenated after a quick hour rubdown. I'd honestly give more stars if I could. Reasonable prices and skilled therapists and super convenient location as well.

Overall, I had a seamless experience! I also found the pricing to be very reasonable, shop was easy to locate as well.

Firstly, I was received by the staff with a warm welcome! The environment was clean and comfortable. I had a 40min foot massage + 20min shoulder massage - my masseuse (Esther) was warm, skilled and adjusted pressure to my preference.

Theres just one part I felt could be improved, I had to walk on the malls floor barefoot after taking off my shoes, into the shop. Maybe some carpets/slippers could be placed at the entrance to enhance this experience. That would make everything perfect!

Went for full body massage, told the masseuse I had neck and back injury before hence the muscles there were stiff. And told her to apply light pressure to these areas.

All went well with my back. She applied light pressure and loosened out the knots just fine.

But for my neck, she went crazy. The first thing she did was take one finger and jab it very hard into the back of my neck (the area between neck and head). The pain was intense. It radiated to the back of my eye and side of my head. The whole night, my neck, head and eye, were aching. Today is the 2nd day, and these areas are still painful. I hope she did not do lasting damage to any nerves.

While she probably meant well, I think she needs to pay better attention to her customers needs. And learn how to massage properly instead of just jabbing really hard.

My first time going for this kind of massage and it was really amazing.
Zi Co massaged me and I experienced the foot and shoulder massage which lasted for 1 hour.
I have back pain and when I mentioned it to him, he was able to help me out and ease my muscle tension.
I also saw there are a lot of foreign customers that came and they mentioned that they are regulars here when they come to Singapore.

Really relaxing. Thank you!

Went there for a session on the 03 June 2019 at 1945hrs. Booking through the website was seamless and the massage store is clean and professional. I went for the package which consist of 40 minutes foot massage and 20 minutes shoulder massage. Jenny was my masseuse and she was very experienced and skilful with the blood circulation points () which provided me with a very relaxing experience. Before the session, my leg felt extremely tensed and heavy but after the session, it felt more relaxed and light. Amazing experience here and the only thing that i regretted for the session is not opting for a longer session!

Thank you Wan Lin for the wonderful experience!

I had a 60-minute full body massage done by Tina. Her technique was really good, she pressed at all the right points and with just the right amount of strength. All my aches just disappeared afterwards. Honestly, it was better than most of the massages I have gotten in Thailand, especially in terms of technique. The ambiance was relaxing and the price is very affordable too! Would definitely go back for more. Tip for others is to book a slot on their website early because the place is usually quite packed.

Wan Lin has the best masseurs and masseuses in Singapore. I had a pleasant half-body massage session, where the masseuse knew where my hardened knots and pains are, and automatically massaged these parts more. She even explained the causes, and recommended some of the poor habits that resulted in body aches. I suggest this healthcare centre to everyone needing a massage, as my whole body relieved after my session!

Went there for a session on the 03 June 2019 at 1945hrs with my boyfriend after a long day at work where my body and legs are sore.

I went for the package which consist of 40 minutes foot massage and 20 minutes shoulder massage together with my boyfriend and June was assigned to me. June was extremely patient and experienced while providing me with the massage and i appreciate her effort for constantly checking with me if the pressure applied was fine. The entire session was extremely soothing and relaxing and June was extremely great with the pressure points with my foot and shoulders. After the session, all the soreness was gone and i felt extremely relieved. The shop in general is very clean and well-equipped with entertainment facilities such as TVs and hot towels to clean your feet. I definitely will recommend you guys to come try it out after a long day of shopping at Bugis Street!

Thank you Wan Lin for the wonderful experience!

I had really bad muscle aches on my legs. Tried to search for foot massage around the vicinity and saw quite a number of good review. Decided to try and I was really amazed by the masseur's massage skill. Kenny really knows what he is doing and my legs feel so much better. 38 dollars for 60 mins. Reasonable price. Will definitely come back again when I need another fix for my legs. :)

Everything was excellent! The staff were very welcoming; the beds were soft; the masseuse (Jenny) was strong and pressed at all the right pressure points and even the payment was convenient since they accept paynow. It was a much needed massage after a stressful week at work. It really helped me to de-stress and relax my muscles. I got the full body massage for 60 minutes and it was surprisingly very affordable. I would highly recommend making a booking early especially if you have a particular masseuse in mind. It was very convenient to do the booking on my phone and I could even choose the masseuse I wanted. Jennys schedule can be quite packed so I suggest booking early.

Came for a massage and booked online in advance with Max at 3pm for foot & shoulder massage.

Place is popular, constantly packed with customers and sat around for 10 minutes and only got in at 3:10pm.

The counter and massuers here all seem busy rushing with back to back schedules and were moving around for toilet breaks / short bites or preparing the place for massage.

Massage was quite a painful experience, but definitely a therapeutic one. The Massuer put in efforts in massaging and is hardworking.

Place is well kept and furnished, with fresh towels.

For this price range in Singapore, it is a good place with great standards.
Highly recommended!

Visited this place due to the good Google reviews. Made a reservation and had Jenny for my full body massage and she was really impressive ! She knew exactly where are the spots that requires more attention. Kenny is really great too as bf was impressed with his strength and skills. Did have some communication blunder when me and my bf came for our booking, was assign to foot massage at first which confuses us. However, the issue was resolved after double checking with the Staffs. Improvement can be made to communications at the reception side  where customers can be provided with clearer instructions and asked for their reservation/preference of massage. Overall, the experience is great. No doubt would visit them again!

1st time here, came because of the high review rating. Total disappointment, wasted time and money. did 90 minutes foot massage. assigned an old uncle who is just wasting time touching and rubbing my skin with lotion, hardly using any bit of strength, wondering if he could even afford more strength to begin with. I didn't request for no oldie/younger upfront because i didn't expect they will assign such an old uncle who barely has any strength, will be very rude to reject when he is in front of me. repeated request for more strength also make me feel bad. i suggest you have to make request upfront no old uncle. if you are fine to be supportive and spend money, no issue or perhaps just donate. if you come with a need for massage just have to request no oldies.

Went for 30min upper body massage. Total waste of money, masseuse was untrained and had no idea what she was doing, no concept of what is muscle, tendon, bone etc, started putting her elbow on my kidneys are, i mean for what?! Just press with her elbows. Came once before and had a guy who was quite good. The problem is there is no consistency in training and technique. Won't go again, just not professional. p/s: It was yesterday (sunday) afternoon, I'd rather not name. Please train your staff and test them properly, there are also other complaints below, if you need to re-test your staff, please do.

Really enjoyed the foot and shoulder massage! My masseur was friendly, experienced and really strong. He made me feel very comfortable and so relieved after the massage. Despite being there during a non-peak period, there was still a lot of customers. So I think it is advisable to book an appointment before heading down! The masseur also customized the massage according to my bodys needs and reaction. Would definitely come back and recommend my friend!

Hi
This was my first time getting reflexology done . Frankly, it was quite painful. I never expected the foot massage this way. But my masseur assured me that I'll feel better after massage. He (Sam) is quite experienced fellow and he's been doing it for quite some time.
After completing the massage, my feet were feeling very light and numb.
As it was my first time, i can't compare it or  call it good or bad.
The ambience was good, the staff was friendly. I went without prior appointment. But there was no waiting period.

Very bad first and probably only experience. With appointment, I have wait for 20min before a masseur is available. Instead of calling it fingerpresss massage, it's more appropriate to call elbow massage. For some reason, 80% of therapy, the masseur elbows you. Highly unpleasant.

The staff were very friendly and my masseuse Jenny knows all the places to press with the right amount of strength.

She made sure to ask if I was okay and gave concern when I rubbed my head after the massaged assuming that I had an headache.

Location is convenient and price is definitely affordable and worth it.

Tried foot massage at wanlin today, it has been a totally new experience for me! The therapist his name is Wong he can be very quiet, start and end without telling you. However you can tell he is very experienced, he kept on asking me to relax my feet but I couldnt as it was so painful. But nothing wrong with him I think my body as a lot of aches and problem thats why causing the pain over the foot. Good try for today, thank you uncle wong but I dont think Im going to do foot massage anymore no matter which shop is that. Haha low pain tolerance.

Ordered a 1.5 hours of massage. The first 1 hour was fine. Although it was a bit forceful, but I told the masseuse to be softer and the force was alright. At the last thirty minutes she just kept rubbing my neck and my face. The amount of force she pressed in my neck was almost the same force as she would applied on my leg. It was quite uncomfortable and she kept using the same rubbing technique on my neck over and over again. It felt very abrasive on the and I told her to massage other areas instead.
Overall the massage is quite clean. The only problem is that it feels like it is just brute force pushing all over the body and lacks a little technique. Didn't feel too good afterwards.. a bit of shoulder pain for a few days after the massage.

Went to Wan Lin to get a quick massage fix on a Sunday afternoon. Did a 45mins upper body massage without much expectations. But boy was I surprised at the level of knowledge my masseur know. After a few minutes my masseur knew exactly what was my problem due to me sitting and staring at the computer for long hours. My masseur had real strength which really helped me unknot all my tension on my shoulders and neck. She does check in on me regularly to ensure that I wasnt in pain. Overall a really pleasant experience and would recommend them to anyone!

Went there twice for a quick fix as I was experiencing shoulder pains. First time I went, it was a male masseuse. Felt much better after. Second time I went, they assigned me another male masseuse, but because I'd opted for cupping of my back and shoulders, he asked me to change out of my clothing and after sensing I was not comfortable with it, he asked another lady to take over. The lady was good too, released the knots in my shoulders, though still in pain but I'm feeling a lot better compared to before the massage. Price is affordable considering the location.

Really good. I chose 40min foot+ 30 min upper body massages after a long flight. I could forget the flight fatigue. I definitely recommend here.

Very reasonably priced massages. I have gone for 3 2-hour massages and the therapists have been consistently of high standard.

Clean and comfortable settings. Went for 60 min back massage by Jackson. He has good technic and the amount of pressure is just right to relief stiffness and feeling relax at the same time.
