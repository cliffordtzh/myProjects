Went there yesterday at 10pm appointment for a 4in1 package and also full body massage for 120mins. Overall experience was above expectations. One of the best massage i and my partner ever had in Singapore. Would like to thanked Hailan and Summer for doing a fantastic job. Highly recommended and surely will be back there soon for another session.

I just finished my 90-min foot massage at Legend.  My feet were swollen due to water retention due to pregnancy.  The masseuse (I didnt manage to get her name ) was amazing.  She checked on pressure and my comfort.  During the entire 90 mins she didnt slack nor did her pressure  She was very considerate and very professional.  During the session, i had a dry cough incident and was immediately attended to with warm water.  After the massage, the masseuse ensured that my feet were wiped off of any excess cream / oil for my safety and even escorted me all the way out.

The masseuse gave me the BEST foot massage ever!  Thanks Legend for a Legendary experience.

You now have a loyal customer!

Great masseur, was very nice and understanding but front desk / receptionist was terrible at service. Did not double check what I wanted and wasted my time but booking the wrong session. Insincere apology was given at the end as well.

Good if you know which masseuse to ask for, value for money. Slight hesitation to go now as I noticed last time they do not check customers temperature, also makes me wonder what else they are compromising on. Saw the masseuses enter one morning and no one took their temperature either!

Generally my experience was good throughout my multiple visits (roughly 10 times), although the last 2 times I had a terrible masseuse. She had rushed hand movements and pressed on my spine and bones a few times. Complained after 30 minutes of the 1 hour massage and they replaced the masseuse, but there was no other compensation for the negative experience other than promising some complimentary scent oil worth SGD 10 the next time I visit. The second masseuse was good. I was advised I should have complained after 15 minutes - however I was never informed about this rule before.

Curious how this will play out the next time I visit. Lost a fair bit of trust but will still give them a chance.

Really good experience. Did an hour of reflexology, and for me, the measure of how good a massage is, is reflected in whether I sleep or not :). Needless to say, I woke myself with my snoring in the midst of the massage. So the therapist definitely hit the right spots.

Massage was good but a spa experience is more than that. Bathroom in room was faulty. Wall mouldy, air con noisy and furnishing was worn out. I should have asked for another room but the fact that I was offered that particular room reflected the service quality.

Very clean place around siglap area 55$ for 1 hr massage at the time of positing. The massueses are the best I have ever seen.

I love this place as this is one of the place that don't pester you to take the packages after your massage. I have been here several times and have recommend several friends relatives to try this place and everyone loved it.

Watch out for their occasional promotion at off peak times that offer free extra half hour massage for the price of 1 hr.

It's a dogdy massage place. Staff don't understand or speak proper English. Not acceptable for the service industry. And I'm not sure about my credit card transaction because i saw i was charged $80 on the machine but the receipt printed out $55 for an hour massage. Asked for a refund and left.

Pass by this place several times and finally we made an appointment for full body massage. My back was hurting for several days and now showing sign of improvement after this session. Place is clean and staffs are friendly.

Great massage everytime. Been there a few times and the massage standard is consistent despite us not having a fixed masseuse to go to. Open till wee hours. Thumbs up if you are staying in the East!

One of the best massage that I had. The therapist knows the exact spot that my back is aching and is able to massage it away. 90 minutes massage seems so fast. Will return again.

New and clean however service and skill level of other similarly priced places in the neighborhood are better. I will suggest bringing your own oil to the massage as they otherwise charge additional $10 per person

Very good Chinese style Tui Na, they will massage and rub your back rigorously with oil, similar to Gua Sha that releases unhealthy elements from your body and stimulates blood flow
