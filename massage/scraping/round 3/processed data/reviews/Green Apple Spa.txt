I have backache and pain after a bad massage. They gave me a masseuse who could not understand English.

I kept telling her I was in pain however she could not understand. It was a painful massage and I now have severe aches that I have not slept well for two days.
Tried contacting Green Apple Spa about my experience and want to advise them to only use English speaking masseuse for non-Chinese customers, however no response.

Ive been to GAS many times before, and it is still my go-to place for massage. Called to reserve a 1.5h slot for leg & shoulder massage, and requested for a private room for couple. Upon arrival, I was welcomed warmly and was shown to the private room 

My masseur was Coco and she would adjust her strength according to my request.

10/10 for service & massage. Would definitely visit GAS again.

First time to this branch, usually visit their Tanjong Pagar branch. Very nice, cozy environment. . Seats were comfortable and they had a big screen playing movies. Staff were all friendly, from reception to masseur. Very skillful and enough pressure, and will check few times with you to make sure pressure was ok. Recommended to visit here.

My masseur Francis knew all the correct pressure points and the perfect amount of pressure to apply. But would constantly ensure that I was comfortable which made me feel very at ease. Not one to go for massages in Singapore but this is my second time here and its worth all the money spent. Will definitely come back and look for Francis again. My mom and sister also really enjoyed the experience cant wait to be back.

Had one of the best massages here. Went for the 30 minutes foot + 60 minutes body massage combo. Receptionist was friendly. We came on Saturday night and got lucky, as we could walk in without an appointment. But it is advisable to make a booking beforehand.

Rated one star down because the foot massage was quite meh. The male masseuse didnt put much pressure and the area we were at (Level 1) was next to their staff resting area, and there was a young male masseuse watching videos without using an earpiece. Kind of disrupting my peace and quiet.

But my body massage was freaking amazing, seriously. I didnt manage to get my masseuses name but ironically, she was much stronger than the male masseuse I had earlier, and paid attention to details to get rid of my knots and muscle soreness.

Will definitely come back.

The receptionist has a pretty poor attitude, she simply can't be bothered whether at the counter or over the phone. This puts a real damper on the overall experience. The massage quality really depends on who is the masseuse, and there's been some hits and misses.

I am satisfied with the massage and experience. Can say this is one of the best massage i had in SG! Did combo 1hr body + 30mins foot and was attended by 2 different masseuse for each. Both was equally good and massage were super on point.
The only downside was the receptionist who did not share the promotion and we actually paid a higher price when we could have enjoyed the discount. Nevertheless the massage makes up for it!
Will come back but will be smarter on the ongoing promo!!

I liked this place. Generally, the masseur here is very well trained although there are some are not. Price is reasonable for Singapore and it's packed most time so do your booking (just call and reserve) early to avoid disappointment. Opens till late night so you almost can get your tired legs cared for while watching a movie on their large screen. If you are looking for a private zone out place, this is not it.

1st time here, made a booking for full body for 3 people,myself and my parents.  we asked if its ok for 1 hour 30 mins for 3 of us , the front counter guy said ok and went to charge the card accordingly.  A few seconds later he said sorry can only do 1 hour, he then went to void the transaction and proceed to ask us to make another payment . After which we went to our rooms, to my horror I had to share the room with my dad. I am not ok with that .I went downstairs to the counter guy and asked him if there are any other single rooms , he said all fully booked. And proceed to blame me for not informing them when he himself didn't confirm with us before payment was made for the 1st and 2nd time. I don't think its a usual practice for us to ask for single rooms , I didn't want to make a wasted trip so I cancelled my full body and opt for foot massage instead for obvious price difference he had to refund cash since we initially paid for 3 full body.  Here comes the worst part, while enjoying my foot massage the counter guy come and interrupted my massage by giving me the refund.  Why can't you give it to me later after my massage? Honestly this would have been a great review if things were better.I'm really not happy with the counter guy working on 27th December 2020 on 9pm when we came

Inconsistent protocol. Booked a 60 minutes body massage today with my friend. She got a good masseuse who communicated with her on the pressure and areas she wanted more work on.

Whereas I got a masseuse who did not ask me a thing and exerted so much pressure throughout even after I told her to be gentler twice. She focused a lot on the top parts of my back that I'm feeling more aches than when I went in. My back feels bruised that I'm having trouble lying on it to sleep now.

There was a bit of head massage which just felt like her pushing her fingers into my scalp and trying to decrease the size of my head.

For $59, the massage was definitely not what I expected, with the masseuse I got. I hope they review their masseuse's skills and ensure all ask simple questions (room temp, pressure, areas to focus more on) to their clients before and during the massage.

Booked a one hour foot massage at this evening and was assigned to the masseuse, Yoyo. I initially already found it strange that a female masseuse is serving me as most of the foot masseuse are males. Her massage was really bad. It felt as if she was playing with my foot during the hour although I can see that she was trying. Seems like a technique/ training issue. Will likely not return and if I really were to do so, I will definitely request for a male masseuse.

It's a great spa, I went for a 60 minute foot massage. The couches in the "cinema room" are v comfortable and it's nice to be able recline and watch a movie if you want. The only reason it's a 4 instead of a 5 is because the toilet smells like a urinal and my feet were slipping in my shoes after, prefer the feet to be washed at the end.

60mins body massage at $56 (without aromatherapy oil). Those interested in body massages will recommend to do at least 90mins.
