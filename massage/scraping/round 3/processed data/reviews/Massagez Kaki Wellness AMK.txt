Really great massage. Masseuse were really friendly and did a good job rubbing away all the knots in my back and shoulder. They were also really knowledgeable in pressure points etc. Will definitely revisit.

Very friendly and skilled masseurs. Very good value for money too. The day we booked only had 1 staff designated at the outlet. However they made the effort to arrange for 1 more staff who came down all the way from their Woodlands outlet so my girlfriend and I could book our preferred slot. We train HIIT & weights quite often and the masseurs were able to loosen all our knotted muscles. Will surely be coming back regularly!

Ive came here for a total of 4 times and will definitely keep coming again. All of the masseur (Gary, David & Ming) are really skilled and friendly. Each visit makes me feel like all my muscles are relaxed. I also signed up for membership for its perks. It offers 1 time FOC massage after signing up and will subsequently offer membership pricing instead of usual price. Theres a complimentary 50% off birthday month too.
Will strongly recommend to try this place out.

I decided to give Massagez Kaki a try after reading the good reviews and I've no regrets. Although it's a small and simple set up tucked within a rather quiet part of AMK, the centre was cozy and brightly lit (not a sleazy kind of place), and Gary was very friendly and professional. I felt at ease despite being there for the first time and having a male masseur. The massage really helped to loosen my tight muscles. I'll definitely be back since I've signed up for the membership as well.

Excellent service, professional and knowledgeable masseurs that are able to resolve my aches and pain. They provide both leg and body massages at very reasonable prices. I have been very particular and high standards about massages, searching for good masseurs all over Singapore. Finally found this place. The staff are well trained, and each time I go for the service, I find that they put their heart to serving the customer. I also like the fact that it is a open concept, so that everything is proper and transparent. Highly recommended.
