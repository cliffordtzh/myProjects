I've been visiting this massage place for about 4 years now, would go once a month, and I really love their services. I've always asked for M to do my massage as she's really good at it, the strength is just right and she's always able to help me relieve my aches. Would really recommend her if you're looking for authentic and good Thai massage!

The massage seems to be random massaging here and there. I said softer but the lady did not understand and continue giving really hard massage. I went with a friend and she feels the same way. Not worth the money and i came out the spa with more pain than when i came in. Not even worth a star.

Totally 5 stars. I usually go to chinatown for thai massage but they were fully booked so I decided to give this place a chance and no regrets at all!
Their style of thai massage is a combination of traditional thai and deep tissue - less twisting of your body but more pressing of your muscle. My masseuse is a thai lady and she gave a very strong massage which totally untied all my knots. I will for sure be back.

Visit here for no frills authentic massage. $60 for 60 mins is higher than average for the curtain partitioned massage beds.
Apparently the price hike by $5:is recent as I see a 4 month old review at older rates.

On the plus side it appears comparatively easier to just walk in or book appointments at short notice on most days as the have many therapists.

Slightly pricey but they are professional masseurs. They have two choices; Thai/oil massage, or the aroma hot oil massage. Prices are as listed in the attached image.

It was painful during the massage but I felt relaxed afterwards. You may let the masseur know how much pressure to you prefer. However I gave only 4 stars as the masseur tend to press very hard on my bones. There was also a time when she was pressing hard on my spine that my legs felt numb.

Otherwise, all was good. Will return if I am in need of a massage

I paid 80 dollars for a 90mins oil massage therapy. The Thai masseur speaks English and get down to business. No time wasting and not rushing. She finished the massage at 90mins. The session is very good i must say compare to many other spa. she knows exactly what is required for the pressure points. The rooms are clean but a bit dated. That is what you will get. No frills. The receptionist at the desk is strict. Perhaps she can be more polite and friendly instead of only instructing customers i.e. hand sanitizer for cleaning your hands ; take off your shoes .etc. she should have said thank to  a few walk in customers including myself  which she didn't. I was observing when i was at the front desk waiting area. I could have rated them 5 stars. On a whole, it was a pleasant experience to me as the massage is good. No pushing of selling massage package or snake oil.

I had jasmine as my masseuse and she was so kind and strong. She tailors it according to where you feel more need for. It was so good i initially paid for 60 min and extended it to 90. Strongly recommend!

Edit: went a second time, had a different lady and it felt like she was just going thru the motions instead of truly massaging. Didnt feel that great after paying a steep 75 dollars for 90 min. Waste of money and time

Had a back pain this morning. So decided to try to this Thai massage after seeing many good review. Massage by a thai lady who knows how to speak chinese. Really good skill and my back pain all gone after 90 mins. Recommended to go. Will go back there  when having back pain again. Overall a very good experience. The price is reasonable as well. Can look for M if you wants to have a good massage to release your back pain.

Was a little concerned that it's sleazy, but it's not (coz of the area)! The Thai auntie who did my massage cracked bones with her feet, and massaged away a lot of my soreness.

She would ask if a certain area needed more to relieve the soreness, though one minor downside was her trying to get me to do 90 mins instead of the 60. That said, the massage is superb. Waiting room is a little small and dingy, but the massage bed that I was assigned was clean.

Came for 60 min Thai traditional (no oil) massage on a public holiday. From reception to interior the place smells very strongly like moth balls. Was led to a table and expected to disrobe I had to remind them I wanted no-oil massage, then after giving me clothes to change into they left me alone waiting for more than 5 minutes.

SAFETY & COMMUNICATION: Masseuse spoke Mandarin and did not understand English, so when I had to inform to please not place body pressure on the metal plate I have in my forearm, we struggled to communicate. Later, she seemed to have weak understanding of technique or her own body form, as when she bent my leg to the side she went right for my spine not my hips I thought alright, maybe its a style. Then switching to the left she seemed to have a different approach, and when pressing onto the joints to the side of my spine, laid her support hand directly on top of the center of my spine. I yelped in pain and seemed to surprise her. She couldnt understand what I was reacting to. Her touch was intended well perhaps but was fierce and imprecise. At the end, when I took a few mins to recover myself (it was not yet a full hour), she came back after setting my tea outside again surprised, saying they needed to clear the room for the next customer. There are no customers waiting and there are other rooms available. Perhaps shes only been trained to churn and burn?

Will not return. According to other reviews there might be better experiences  my masseuse was Ying, who might work for people who arent that aware of their body and like this approach.

Went on 12 Jul afternoon, paid for oil massage. Wasn't informed by the receptionist that oil massage is unavailable. Until I was in the massage room, the lady covered me few layers of towel and press above the towel which I thought it was a warm up. Aft about 20 mins, I asked the massage lady whether there is oil massage, the lady told me oil massage is unavailable as per government's guidelines during covid period.

After massage is done, my hubby in the next room came out and told me he had oil massage. So I was fooled by the receptionist or the massage lady...?

4 star because the massage is still done well & hubby enjoyed it too.

Pretty decent massage. Therapist was very skilled and when I said my shoulders needed work she 100% nailed it. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is due to the staff constantly talking throughout the rooms. It's quite off-putting when trying to relax. Otherwise really reasonably priced massage!

Worst massage I've ever been to. The masseuse had incredibly long nails and dry callous hands which made it incredibly uncomfortable - basically scratching my entire body raw. Would not recommend or come back. Also very rough in style and rushed. I've been to hundreds of Thai massage places and this was the worst. Whenever you ask for softer hands, she would just laugh at you with the other ladies and wouldn't change her method. My body is sore and bruised. Terrible service. When I mentioned this at the end of the massage to the main lady running the business - she was too busy counting her cash at the til to even care. Poor service!

I tried catching a quick power nap as well :) but occasionally masseuse were talking within themselves hence that kept me awake. But overall a very good experience. The massage service is very professional and my masseuse seemed very experienced. Thumbs Up!

Exceptional thai massage with an exceptional masseuse. These women work hard everyday and yet they provide a high quality massage at each and every time. I gave her a tip, the price (90 mins = 75$ and available right away) is more than fair and the massage was really great. I would encourage tourists to always leave a tip, there is a lot of hard work and not always recognized. Thank you to the lady that made my day with this massage! Loved it

This is the other reasonably cheap and professional Thai massage parlours in Singapore, right before Loy Krathong Thai massage in Aljunied. The authentic Thai masseuses here are very skillful and mindful if you mention about existing injuries. The place is well-kept, clean and has a nice ambience. As someone who does sports regularly and is prone to soreness and muscular injuries, I find that the massages here really helped me in recovering. Highly recommended place!

I have had 100s of Thai massages before (no exaggeration) and that was hands down the best one! Payed for 1hr 30m with Rse. She was from Thailand like the rest of the masseuses and was definitely very experienced. She applied hard/firm force and knew exactly what needed work. I feel like the 90 mins was the correct time needed to cover everything properly. I think what makes a good masseuse is that they can find your troubled spots without you telling them, and she did exactly that. 10/10

I would not come here ever. The masseuse was a much older lady who was so rough and I kept telling her that she is massaging my bones. Not my muscle. Then she goes on to use her knees to place pressure on my back. I told her its too much and she started complaining in mandarin on how I was being difficult becoz I didnt want my bones massaged. Only for her to realize that I understood mandarin and she was stumped. Im left with a kink in my back now thanks to her.
