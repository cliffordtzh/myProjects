Clean, friendly spa with good new facilities. Cherry does the massage for me and she is very good and able to release all the knots well. There are also shower facilities, at no extra charge. Easy to go there after a workout.

A new and nicely renovated spa with great ambience. Pricing is reasonable. Receptionist was friendly.

Had my massage by Anna. The best masseur I ever met. Pretty, polite, very professional and skillful. She does not rush for her job. Tensed and tired body was feeling relaxed after the massage. Tipped her in appreciation for her hard work. Will definitely visit her again.
